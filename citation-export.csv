"CD009405.PUB2","Horvat, L; Horey, D; Romios, P; Kis‐Rigo, J","Cultural competence education for health professionals","Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","2014","Abstract - Background Cultural competence education for health professionals aims to ensure all people receive equitable, effective health care, particularly those from culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) backgrounds. It has emerged as a strategy in high‐income English‐speaking countries in response to evidence of health disparities, structural inequalities, and poorer quality health care and outcomes among people from minority CALD backgrounds. However there is a paucity of evidence to link cultural competence education with patient, professional and organisational outcomes. To assess efficacy, for this review we developed a four‐dimensional conceptual framework comprising educational content, pedagogical approach, structure of the intervention, and participant characteristics to provide consistency in describing and assessing interventions. We use the term 'CALD participants' when referring to minority CALD populations as a whole. When referring to participants in included studies we describe them in terms used by study authors. Objectives To assess the effects of cultural competence education interventions for health professionals on patient‐related outcomes, health professional outcomes, and healthcare organisation outcomes. Search methods We searched: MEDLINE (OvidSP) (1946 to June 2012); Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL,  The Cochrane Library ) (June 2012); EMBASE (OvidSP) (1988 to June 2012); CINAHL (EbscoHOST) (1981 to June 2012); PsycINFO (OvidSP) (1806 to June 2012); Proquest Dissertations and Theses database (1861 to October 2011); ERIC (CSA) (1966 to October 2011); LILACS (1982 to March 2012); and Current Contents (OvidSP) (1993 Week 27 to June 2012). Searches in MEDLINE, CENTRAL, PsycINFO, EMBASE, Proquest Dissertations and Theses, ERIC and Current Contents were updated in February 2014. Searches in CINAHL were updated in March 2014. There were no language restrictions. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster RCTs, and controlled clinical trials of educational interventions for health professionals working in health settings that aimed to improve: health outcomes of patients/consumers of minority cultural and linguistic backgrounds; knowledge, skills and attitudes of health professionals in delivering culturally competent care; and healthcare organisation performance in culturally competent care. Data collection and analysis We used the conceptual framework as the basis for data extraction. Two review authors independently extracted data on interventions, methods, and outcome measures and mapped them against the framework. Additional information was sought from study authors. We present results in narrative and tabular form. Main results We included five RCTs involving 337 healthcare professionals and 8400 patients; at least 3463 (41%) were from CALD backgrounds. Trials compared the effects of cultural competence training for health professionals, with no training. Three studies were from the USA, one from Canada and one from The Netherlands. They involved health professionals of diverse backgrounds, although most were not from CALD minorities. Cultural background was determined using a validated scale (one study), self‐report (two studies) or not reported (two studies). The design effect from clustering meant an effective minimum sample size of 3164 CALD participants. No meta‐analyses were performed. The quality of evidence for each outcome was judged to be low. Two trials comparing cultural competence training with no training found no evidence of effect for treatment outcomes, including the proportion of patients with diabetes achieving LDL cholesterol control targets (risk difference (RD) ‐0.02, 95% CI ‐0.06 to 0.02; 1 study, USA, 2699 ""black"" patients, moderate quality), or change in weight loss (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.07, 95% CI ‐0.41 to 0.55, 1 study, USA, effective sample size (ESS) 68 patients, low quality). Health behaviour (client concordance with attendance) improved significantly among intervention participants compared with controls (relative risk (RR) 1.53, 95% CI 1.03 to 2.27, 1 study, USA, ESS 28 women, low quality). Involvement in care by ""non‐Western"" patients (described as ""mainly Turkish, Moroccan, Cape Verdean and Surinamese patients"") with largely ""Western"" doctors improved in terms of mutual understanding (SMD 0.21, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.42, 1 study, The Netherlands, 109 patients, low quality). Evaluations of care were mixed (three studies). Two studies found no evidence of effect in: proportion of patients reporting satisfaction with consultations (RD 0.14, 95% CI ‐0.03 to 0.31, 1 study, The Netherlands, 109 patients, low quality); patient scores of physician cultural competency (SMD 0.11 95% CI ‐0.63 to 0.85, 1 study, USA, ESS 68 ""Caucasian"" and ""non‐Causcasian"" patients (described as Latino, African American, Asian and other, low quality). Client perceptions of health professionals were significantly higher in the intervention group (SMD 1.60 95% CI 1.05 to 2.15, 1 study, USA, ESS 28 ""Black"" women, low quality). No study assessed adverse outcomes. There was no evidence of effect on clinician awareness of ""racial"" differences in quality of care among clients at a USA health centre (RR 1.37, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.94. P = 0.07) with no adjustment for clustering. Included studies did not measure other outcomes of interest. Sensitivity analyses using different values for the Intra‐cluster coefficient (ICC) did not substantially alter the magnitude or significance of summary effect sizes. All four domains of the conceptual framework were addressed, suggesting agreement on core components of cultural competence education interventions may be possible. Authors' conclusions Cultural competence continues to be developed as a major strategy to address health inequities. Five studies assessed the effects of cultural competence education for health professionals on patient‐related outcomes. There was positive, albeit low‐quality evidence, showing improvements in the involvement of CALD patients. Findings either showed support for the educational interventions or no evidence of effect. No studies assessed adverse outcomes. The quality of evidence is insufficient to draw generalisable conclusions, largely due to heterogeneity of the interventions in content, scope, design, duration, implementation and outcomes selected. Further research is required to establish greater methodological rigour and uniformity on core components of education interventions, including how they are described and evaluated. Our conceptual framework provides a basis for establishing consensus to improve reporting and allow assessment across studies and populations. Future studies should measure the patient outcomes used: treatment outcomes; health behaviours; involvement in care and evaluations of care. Studies should also measure the impact of these types of interventions on healthcare organisations, as these are likely to affect uptake and sustainability. Plain language summary Cultural competence education for health professionals This review assessed the effects of cultural competence education for health professionals. Five studies were included involving 337 health professionals (including general practitioners, primary care teams and counsellors) and 8400 patients. Three studies were conducted in the USA, one in Canada and one in The Netherlands. At least 3000 patients were from culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) backgrounds and some of the health professional groups were also from CALD backgrounds. Due to differences in terminology and their cultural meanings, and the evolving nature of concepts and practices in this area, in this review we use the term 'CALD participants' when referring to minority, CALD populations as a whole. When referring to participants in included studies we describe them in the terms used by the relevant study authors. The studies differed in how the education was provided and which outcome measures were used. Involvement in care improved in one study in The Netherlands measuring mutual understanding between minority CALD background patients and their doctors. Health behaviour also changed in one small study in the USA, in which women whose counsellors had received education were three times more likely to attend planned counselling sessions. However there was no evidence of an effect on a range of treatment outcomes or evaluations of care. None of the five included studies examined the effect of cultural competence education on healthcare organisations, or assessed adverse outcomes. The review findings showed some support for cultural competence education for health professionals. These findings are tentative, however, as the quality of the evidence was low and more data are needed. Future research on cultural competence education for health professionals should seek greater consensus on the core components of cultural competence education, how participants are described and the outcomes assessed.","5","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","Canada; Cultural Competency [*education]; Cultural Diversity; Health Personnel [*education]; Healthcare Disparities; Humans; Minority Groups; Netherlands; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; United States","10.1002/14651858.CD009405.pub2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD009405.pub2","Consumers and Communication"
"CD011429.PUB2","Carr, PJ; Higgins, NS; Cooke, ML; Mihala, G; Rickard, CM","Vascular access specialist teams for device insertion and prevention of failure","Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","2018","Abstract - Background Most people admitted to hospitals worldwide require a vascular access device (VAD). Hundreds of millions of VADs are inserted annually in the USA with reports of over a billion peripheral intravenous catheters used annually worldwide. Numerous reports suggest that a team approach for the assessment, insertion, and maintenance of VADs improves clinical outcomes, the patient experience, and healthcare processes. Objectives To compare the use of the vascular access specialist team (VAST) for VAD insertion and care to a generalist model approach for hospital or community participants requiring a VAD in terms of insertion success, device failure, and cost‐effectiveness. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2018, Issue 1); Ovid MEDLINE (1950 to 7 February 2018); Ovid Embase (1980 to 7 February 2018); EBSCO CINAHL (1982 to 7 February 2018); Web of Science Conference Proceedings Citation Index ‐ Science and Social Science and Humanities (1990 to 7 February 2018); and Google Scholar. We searched the following trial registries: Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Register ( www.anzctr.org.au ); ClinicalTrials.gov ( www.clinicaltrials.gov ); Current Controlled Trials ( www.controlled‐trials.com/mrct ); HKU Clinical Trials Registry ( www.hkclinicaltrials.com ); Clinical Trials Registry ‐ India ( ctri.nic.in/Clinicaltrials/login.php ); UK Clinical Trials Gateway ( www.controlled‐trials.com/ukctr/ ); and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) ( www.who.int/trialsearch ). We searched all databases on 7 February 2018. Selection criteria We planned to include randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated the effectiveness of VAST or specialist inserters for their impact on clinical outcomes. Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological procedures recommended by Cochrane and used Covidence software to assist with file management. Main results We retrieved 2398 citations: 30 studies were eligible for further examination of their full text, and we found one registered clinical trial in progress. No studies could be included in the analysis or review. We assigned one study as awaiting classification, as it has not been accepted for publication. Authors' conclusions This systematic review failed to locate relevant published RCTs to support or refute the assertion that vascular access specialist teams are superior to the generalist model. A vascular access specialist team has advanced knowledge with regard to insertion techniques, clinical care, and management of vascular access devices, whereas a generalist model comprises nurses, doctors, or other designated healthcare professionals in the healthcare facility who may have less advanced insertion techniques and who care for vascular access devices amongst other competing clinical tasks. However, this conclusion may change once the one study awaiting classification and one ongoing study are published. There is a need for good‐quality RCTs to evaluate the efficacy of a vascular access specialist team approach for vascular access device insertion and care for the prevention of failure. Plain language summary Vascular access specialist teams for insertion of and prevention of vascular access device failure Review question We reviewed the evidence concerning the effectiveness of vascular access specialist teams (VAST) compared with generalist models in terms of vascular access device insertion success, device failure, and cost‐effectiveness. We did not find any eligible studies for our review. Background We describe a VAST as the grouping of healthcare personnel who have advanced knowledge and skills in the assessment, insertion, care, and management of vascular access devices, such as infusion/intravenous, intravenous therapy teams, as well as individual vascular access specialists (nurse, doctor, therapist, technician, and physician assistant). Our goal was to evaluate if the VAST approach is superior to a generalist approach. We define a generalist model or approach as a larger groups of nurses, doctors, or other designated healthcare professionals in the healthcare facility who have less advanced skills and knowledge in inserting and managing vascular access devices. We define a vascular access device (VAD) as a catheter (thin tube) inserted into veins or ports that can be implanted under the skin, allowing fluids and medicines to be delivered into veins. Catheters inserted into arteries can be used to monitor therapy. The most common VAD, the peripheral intravenous catheter (PIVC), may remain in place for many days before removal. Implanted VADs or catheters in central veins can usually remain for many weeks, months, and in some cases, particularly with ports, years. Vascular access devices are used for giving fluids (infusion therapy) and intravenous (injected into a vein) medicines, taking blood samples, and invasive monitoring, and are often crucial in providing treatment and care. The use of VADs and infusion therapy extends across almost all medical, surgical, and critical care specialties, and occurs in hospital, long‐term care, and home care settings. There are several risks related to the insertion of a VAD and its ongoing care that can cause the device to fail (to become no longer suitable for care). One significant postinsertion complication includes catheter‐related venous thrombosis (clot formation). People with cancer or who are critically ill and may require additional medical interventions to treat thrombosis are particularly at risk for this complication. A risk of infusion‐related inflammation of the vein (phlebitis or thrombophlebitis) exists for the PIVC when the cannulated vein becomes painful with other potential signs such as a red appearance at the insertion site. Infection risks such as catheter‐related bloodstream infections are associated with all VADs; preventing such occurrences is a healthcare priority. Catheter‐related bloodstream infections are associated with longer hospital stay, serious illness, death, and increased health service costs. Study characteristics We searched a wide range of medical databases on 7 February 2018. We identified 2398 potential studies, 30 of which we looked at in detail. We found one suitable study, however although the study is complete the manuscript has not yet been accepted for publication, and so we were unable to analyse the data. We have assigned the study as awaiting classification; once its results are published we will evaluate it again and decide if it is eligible for inclusion in the review. We found one registered trial that is investigating our review question, but it is still ongoing and not yet completed or published. Key results We failed to locate any published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to support or refute the assertion that vascular access specialist teams are superior to the generalist model for device insertion and prevention of failure. However, this conclusion may change once the one study awaiting classification and the one ongoing study are published. There is a need for good‐quality RCTs to evaluate the efficacy of a VAST approach for VAD insertion and prevention of failure. An RCT is a study (or trial) that aims to reduce bias when testing a new treatment. The people taking part in the trial are randomly allocated to either the group receiving the treatment under investigation or to a group receiving standard treatment (or placebo treatment) as the control. Quality of evidence We did not analyse the quality of the evidence as we did not find any suitable studies to include in our review.","3","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Cardiology; *Vascular Access Devices; Humans; Workforce","10.1002/14651858.CD011429.pub2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD011429.pub2","Emergency and Critical Care"
"CD011736.PUB2","Vaona, A; Banzi, R; Kwag, KH; Rigon, G; Cereda, D; Pecoraro, V; Tramacere, I; Moja, L","E‐learning for health professionals","Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","2018","Abstract - Background The use of e‐learning, defined as any educational intervention mediated electronically via the Internet, has steadily increased among health professionals worldwide. Several studies have attempted to measure the effects of e‐learning in medical practice, which has often been associated with large positive effects when compared to no intervention and with small positive effects when compared with traditional learning (without access to e‐learning). However, results are not conclusive. Objectives To assess the effects of e‐learning programmes versus traditional learning in licensed health professionals for improving patient outcomes or health professionals' behaviours, skills and knowledge. Search methods We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, five other databases and three trial registers up to July 2016, without any restrictions based on language or status of publication. We examined the reference lists of the included studies and other relevant reviews. If necessary, we contacted the study authors to collect additional information on studies. Selection criteria Randomised trials assessing the effectiveness of e‐learning versus traditional learning for health professionals. We excluded non‐randomised trials and trials involving undergraduate health professionals. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently selected studies, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We graded the certainty of evidence for each outcome using the GRADE approach and standardised the outcome effects using relative risks (risk ratio (RR) or odds ratio (OR)) or standardised mean difference (SMD) when possible. Main results We included 16 randomised trials involving 5679 licensed health professionals (4759 mixed health professionals, 587 nurses, 300 doctors and 33 childcare health consultants). When compared with traditional learning at 12‐month follow‐up, low‐certainty evidence suggests that e‐learning may make little or no difference for the following patient outcomes: the proportion of patients with low‐density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol of less than 100 mg/dL (adjusted difference 4.0%, 95% confidence interval (CI) −0.3 to 7.9, N = 6399 patients, 1 study) and the proportion with glycated haemoglobin level of less than 8% (adjusted difference 4.6%, 95% CI −1.5 to 9.8, 3114 patients, 1 study). At 3‐ to 12‐month follow‐up, low‐certainty evidence indicates that e‐learning may make little or no difference on the following behaviours in health professionals: screening for dyslipidaemia (OR 0.90, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.06, 6027 patients, 2 studies) and treatment for dyslipidaemia (OR 1.15, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.48, 5491 patients, 2 studies). It is uncertain whether e‐learning improves or reduces health professionals' skills (2912 health professionals; 6 studies; very low‐certainty evidence), and it may make little or no difference in health professionals' knowledge (3236 participants; 11 studies; low‐certainty evidence). Due to the paucity of studies and data, we were unable to explore differences in effects across different subgroups. Owing to poor reporting, we were unable to collect sufficient information to complete a meaningful 'Risk of bias' assessment for most of the quality criteria. We evaluated the risk of bias as unclear for most studies, but we classified the largest trial as being at low risk of bias. Missing data represented a potential source of bias in several studies. Authors' conclusions When compared to traditional learning, e‐learning may make little or no difference in patient outcomes or health professionals' behaviours, skills or knowledge. Even if e‐learning could be more successful than traditional learning in particular medical education settings, general claims of it as inherently more effective than traditional learning may be misleading. Plain language summary Is e‐learning more effective than traditional learning for health professionals? What is the aim of this review? The aim of this Cochrane Review is to find out whether e‐learning, that is, interactive online educational programmes, is more effective than traditional learning (with no access to e‐learning) in licensed health professionals for improving patient outcomes or health professionals' behaviours, skills and knowledge. Cochrane researchers collected and analysed all relevant evidence to answer this question and identified 16 studies. Key messages When compared to traditional learning, e‐learning may make little or no difference for improving patient outcomes or health professionals' behaviours and knowledge, and it is uncertain whether it improves or reduces health professionals' skills. What was studied in this review? Modern technologies have created new platforms for advancing medical education. E‐learning has gained popularity due to the potential benefits of personalised instruction, allowing learners to tailor the pace and content of courses to their individual needs, increasing the accessibility of information to remote learners, decreasing costs and facilitating frequent content updates. Previous reviews have not identified differences, but they were limited by the type of participants included (mix of licensed health professionals and medical students) and study types evaluated (randomised together with non‐randomised trials). What are the main results of the review? The review authors identified 16 relevant studies from 10 different countries, providing data on 5679 participants (4759 mixed health professionals, 587 nurses, 300 doctors and 33 childcare health consultants). Companies funded three studies, whereas government agencies financed six. One study with 847 health professionals found little or no difference between e‐learning and traditional learning on patient outcomes at one year, and two studies with 950 health professionals suggested little to no difference in health professionals' behaviours at 3 to 12 months, as the certainty of the evidence was low. We are uncertain whether e‐learning improves or reduces health professionals' skills at 0 to 12 weeks' follow‐up, based on the results of six studies with 2912 participants and very low certainty of evidence. E‐learning may also make little or no difference on health professionals' knowledge, based on the results from 11 studies with 3236 participants at 0 to 12 weeks follow‐up, as the certainty of the evidence was low. How up‐to‐date is this review? The review authors searched for studies that had been published up to July 2016.","1","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Internet; Clinical Competence; Education, Distance [*methods]; Health Personnel [*education, statistics & numerical data]; Humans; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic","10.1002/14651858.CD011736.pub2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD011736.pub2","Effective Practice and Organisation of Care"

Objectives The objective was to assess the effect of educational games on health professionals' performance, knowledge, skills, attitude and satisfaction, and on patient outcomes. Search methods We searched the following databases in January 2012: MEDLINE, AMED, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Database of Controlled Trials, EMBASE, EPOC Register, ERIC, Proquest Dissertations & Theses Database, and PsycINFO. Related reviews were sought in DARE and the above named databases. Database searches identified 1546 citations. We also screened the reference lists of included studies in relevant reviews, contacted authors of relevant papers and reviews, and searched ISI Web of Science for papers citing studies included in the review. These search methods identified an additional 62 unique citations for a total of 1608 for this update. Selection criteria We included randomized controlled trials (RCT), controlled clinical trials (CCT), controlled before and after (CBA) and interrupted time‐series analysis (ITS). Study participants were qualified health professionals or in postgraduate training. The intervention was an educational game with ""a form of competitive activity or sport played according to rules"". Data collection and analysis Using a standardized data form we extracted data on methodological quality, participants, interventions and outcomes of interest that included patient outcomes, professional behavior (process of care outcomes), and professional's knowledge, skills, attitude and satisfaction. Main results The search strategy identified a total of 2079 unique citations. Out of 84 potentially eligible citations, we included two RCTs. The game evaluated in the first study used as a reinforcement technique, was based on the television game show ""Family Feud"" and focused on infection control. The study did not assess any patient or process of care outcomes. The group that was randomized to the game had statistically higher scores on the knowledge test (P = 0.02). The second study compared game‐based learning (""Snakes and Ladders"" board game) with traditional case‐based learning of stroke prevention and management. The effect on knowledge was not statistically different between the two groups immediately and 3 months after the intervention. The level of reported enjoyment was higher in the game‐based group. Authors' conclusions The findings of this systematic review neither confirm nor refute the utility of games as a teaching strategy for health professionals. There is a need for additional high‐quality research to explore the impact of educational games on patient and performance outcomes. Plain language summary Educational games to improve health care professional practice and care for patients There have been many ways developed to improve how health care professionals care for their patients. One way is to use games to improve their knowledge and skills, and change their attitudes and performance. This review found two eligible studies. The first study evaluated a game based on the TV show Family Feud and taught about infection control. The second study evaluated the use of a ""Snakes and Ladders"" board game in continuing medical education on stroke prevention and management. The two studies did not consistently show a beneficial effect on knowledge. We are therefore very uncertain whether games improve health care professional practice or patient care.","3","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Games, Experimental; *Problem Solving; *Professional Competence; *Video Games; Attitude of Health Personnel; Competitive Behavior; Health Personnel [*education]; Humans; Job Satisfaction; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Retention, Psychology","10.1002/14651858.CD006411.pub4","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD006411.pub4","Effective Practice and Organisation of Care"
"CD006327.PUB3","Henderson, A; Henderson, S","Provision of a surgeon's performance data for people considering elective surgery","Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","2015","Abstract - Background A consumer model of health supports that people undergoing elective surgery should be informed about the past operative performance of their surgeon before making two important decisions: 1. to consent to the proposed surgery, and 2. to have a particular doctor perform the surgery. This information arguably helps empower patients to participate in their care. While surgeons' performance data are available in some settings, there continues to be controversy over the provision of such data to patients, and the question of whether consumers should, or want to, be provided with this information. Objectives To assess the effects of providing a surgeon's performance data to people considering elective surgery on patient‐based and service utilisation outcomes. Search methods For the original review, we searched: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL,  The Cochrane Library,  2009, Issue 4); MEDLINE (Ovid) (1950 to 28 September 2009); EMBASE (Ovid) (1988 to 28 September 2009); PsycINFO (Ovid) (1806 to 28 September 2009); CINAHL (EBSCO) (1982 to 20 October 2009); Current Contents (Ovid) (1992 to 23 November 2009); and ProQuest Dissertations and Theses (1861 to 20 October 2009). For this update, we searched: CENTRAL (2009 to 3 March 2014); MEDLINE (Ovid) (2009 to 3 March 2014); EMBASE (Ovid) (2009 to 3 March 2014); PsycINFO (Ovid) (2009 to 9 March 2014); CINAHL (EBSCO) (2009 to 9 March 2014), Current Contents (Web of Science) (November 2009 to 21 March 2014), and ProQuest Dissertations and Theses (2009 to 21 March 2014). We applied no language restrictions. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster RCTs, quasi‐RCTs and controlled before and after studies (CBAs), in which an individual surgeon's performance data were provided to people considering elective surgery. We considered the CBAs for inclusion from 2009 onwards. Data collection and analysis Two review authors (AH, SH) independently assessed all titles, abstracts, or both of retrieved citations. We identified no studies for inclusion. Consequently, we conducted no data collection or analysis. Main results We found no studies that met the inclusion criteria; therefore, there are no results to report on the effect of the provision of a surgeon's performance data for people considering elective surgery. Authors' conclusions We found no studies reporting the impact of the provision of a surgeon's performance data for people considering elective surgery. This is an important finding in itself. While the public reporting of a surgeon's performance is not a new concept, the efficacy of this data for individual patients has not been empirically tested. A review of qualitative studies or new primary qualitative research may be useful to determine what interventions are currently in use and explore the attitudes of consumers and professionals towards such interventions. Plain language summary Provision of a surgeon's performance data for people considering elective surgery Review question We reviewed the evidence about the effect of providing information about a surgeon's performance to people who are thinking of having elective surgery. Elective surgery is defined as ""surgery of a non emergency nature; although recommended, it can be scheduled in advance without affecting the health of the patient or the expected result of the procedure"" ( Dox 2004 , p. 452). Background Measuring the performance of surgeons is generally thought to be a good practice that will result in better surgical results. Providing information about the performance of individual surgeons is more controversial and it is not clear what effect giving consumers this information might have. We wanted to discover whether there was any evidence about the effect of making data about a surgeon's performance available to people who are thinking about having elective surgery, compared with people making similar decisions without this information. Key results There have been studies on ways of collecting and reporting information about the performance of surgeons, but we did not find any studies published before March 2014 that looked at the effect of this information on consumers. This lack of evidence may reflect the practical difficulties and ethical issues involved in researching this topic. For example, surgeons might not be willing to take part in such studies. There might also be legal or ethical problems with providing only some patients with information about a surgeon's performance. However, it would be helpful to have more information to inform debate on this topic. Qualitative studies are needed that explore the attitudes of consumers and professionals towards providing this type of information, and their beliefs about potential effects.","2","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Professional Competence; Elective Surgical Procedures [*standards]; Humans; Specialties, Surgical [*standards]","10.1002/14651858.CD006327.pub3","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD006327.pub3","Consumers and Communication"

Additional advantages of CCT include the potential for reduced variability in treatment and care through clinical decision support enabled by the analysis of large data sets and the use of predictive tools. Evidence points to health systems investing in telemedicine appearing better prepared to respond to sudden increases in demand, such as during pandemics. However, challenges with how new technologies such as CCT are implemented still remain, and must be carefully considered. Objectives This synthesis links to and complements another Cochrane Review assessing the effects of interactive telemedicine in healthcare, by examining the implementation of telemedicine specifically in critical care. Our aim was to identify, appraise and synthesise qualitative research evidence on healthcare stakeholders’ perceptions and experiences of factors affecting the implementation of CCT, and to identify factors that are more likely to ensure successful implementation of CCT for subsequent consideration and assessment in telemedicine effectiveness reviews. Search methods We searched MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and Web of Science for eligible studies from inception to 14 October 2019; alongside 'grey' and other literature searches. There were no language, date or geographic restrictions. Selection criteria We included studies that used qualitative methods for data collection and analysis. Studies included views from healthcare stakeholders including bedside and CCT hub critical care personnel, as well as administrative, technical, information technology, and managerial staff, and family members. Data collection and analysis We extracted data using a predetermined extraction sheet. We used the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) qualitative checklist to assess the methodological rigour of individual studies. We followed the Best‐fit framework approach using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) to inform our data synthesis.  We classified additional themes not captured by CFIR under a separate theme. We used the GRADE CERQual approach to assess confidence in the findings. Main results We found 13 relevant studies. Twelve were from the USA and one was from Canada. Where we judged the North American focus of the studies to be a concern for a finding’s relevance, we have reflected this in our assessment of confidence in the finding. The studies explored the views and experiences of bedside and hub critical care personnel; administrative, technical, information technology, and managerial staff; and family members. The intensive care units (ICUs) were from tertiary hospitals in urban and rural areas. We identified several factors that could influence the implementation of CCT. We had high confidence in the following findings: Hospital staff and family members described several advantages of CCT.  Bedside and hub staff strongly believed that the main advantage of CCT was having access to experts when bedside physicians were not available. Families also valued having access to critical care experts. In addition, hospital staff described how CCT could support clinical decision‐making and mentoring of junior staff.  Hospital staff greatly valued the nature and quality of social networks between the bedside and CCT hub teams . Key issues for them were trust, acceptance, teamness, familiarity and effective communication between the two teams. Interactions between some bedside and CCT hub staff were featured with tension, frustration and conflict.  Staff on both sides commonly described disrespect of their expertise, resistance and animosity. Hospital staff thought it was important to promote and offer training in the use of CCT before its implementation.  This included rehearsing every step in the process, offering staff opportunities to ask questions and disseminating learning resources. Some also complained that experienced staff were taken away from bedside care and re‐allocated to the CCT hub team. Hospital staff's attitudes towards, knowledge about and value placed on CCT influenced acceptance of CCT.  Staff were positive towards CCT because of its several advantages. But some were concerned that the CCT hub staff were not able to understand the patient’s situation through the camera. Some were also concerned about confidentiality of patient data. We also identified other factors that could influence the implementation of CCT, although our confidence in these findings is moderate or low. These factors included the extent to which telemedicine software was adaptable to local needs, and hub staff were aware of local norms; concerns about additional administrative work and cost; patients' and families’ desire to stay close to their local community; the type of hospital setting; the extent to which there was support from senior leadership; staff access to information about policies and procedures; individuals' stage of change; staff motivation, competence and values; clear strategies for staff engagement; feedback about progress; and the impact of CCT on staffing levels. Authors' conclusions Our review identified several factors that could influence the acceptance and use of telemedicine in critical care. These include the value that hospital staff and family members place on having access to critical care experts, staff access to sufficient training, and the extent to which healthcare providers at the bedside and the critical care experts supporting them from a distance acknowledge and respect each other’s expertise. Further research, especially in contexts other than North America, with different cultures, norms and practices will strengthen the evidence base for the implementation of CCT internationally and our confidence in these findings. Implementation of CCT appears to be growing in importance in the context of global pandemic management, especially in countries with wide geographical dispersion and limited access to critical care expertise. For successful implementation, policymakers and other stakeholders should consider pre‐empting and addressing factors that may affect implementation, including strengthening teamness between bedside and hub teams; engaging and supporting frontline staff; training ICU clinicians on the use of CCT prior to its implementation; and ensuring staff have access to information and knowledge about when, why and how to use CCT for maximum benefit. Plain language summary What are healthcare stakeholders’ perceptions and experiences of factors affecting the implementation of critical care telemedicine? What is the aim of this review? The aim of this review was to identify factors that affect the acceptance and use of health care from a distance (known as telemedicine) for patients in intensive care units (also known as critical care). To answer this question, we searched for and analysed qualitative studies about the perceptions and experiences of clinical staff, managers and administrators, as well as patients and family members. This review links to another Cochrane Review assessing the effects of telemedicine.  Key messages Our review identified several factors that could influence the acceptance and use of telemedicine in critical care. These included the value that hospital staff and family members place on having access to critical care experts, staff access to sufficient training, and the extent to which healthcare providers at the bedside and the critical care experts supporting them from a distance acknowledge and respect each other’s expertise. What was studied in this synthesis? In critical care telemedicine (CCT), patients in intensive care units (ICUs) are monitored by critical care experts based at a ‘hub’ outside the hospital. By monitoring patients, hub staff are able to warn staff at the bedside of potential problems and offer them decision support. The use of CCT means that patients and staff in rural or small hospitals have access to critical care experts. But there may still be challenges when implementing CCT. In this review, we assessed studies that looked at the perceptions and experiences of healthcare workers, family members and others to find factors that could influence the acceptance and use of CCT. What are the main findings of the synthesis? We included 13 relevant studies. Twelve were from the USA and one was from Canada. Where we judged the North American focus of the studies to be a concern for a finding’s relevance, we have reflected this in our assessment of confidence in the finding. The studies explored the views and experiences of bedside and hub critical care personnel; administrative, technical, information technology, and managerial staff, and family members. The ICUs were from hospitals in both urban and rural areas. We identified several factors that could influence the acceptance and use of CCT. We had high confidence in the following findings: Hospital staff and family members described several advantages of CCT. Bedside and hub staff strongly believed that the main advantage of CCT was having access to experts when bedside doctors were not available. Families also valued having access to critical care experts. Hospital staff also described how CCT could support clinical decision‐making and mentoring of junior staff.  Hospital staff greatly valued the nature and quality of social networks between the bedside and CCT hub teams. Key issues for them were trust, acceptance, being part of a team, familiarity and effective communication between the two teams. Interactions between some bedside and CCT hub staff were featured with tension, frustration and conflict. Staff on both sides commonly described disrespect of expertise, resistance and animosity. Hospital staff thought it was important to promote and offer training in the use of CCT before its implementation.

Training mid‐level providers, such as midwives, nurses and other non‐physician providers, to conduct first trimester aspiration abortions and manage medical abortions has been proposed as a way to increase women's access to safe abortion procedures. Objectives To assess the safety and effectiveness of abortion procedures administered by mid‐level providers compared to doctors. Search methods We searched the CENTRAL Issue 7, MEDLINE and POPLINE databases for comparative studies of doctor and mid‐level providers of abortion services. We searched for studies published in any language from January 1980 until 15 August 2014. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) (clustered or not clustered), prospective cohort studies or observational studies that compared the safety or effectiveness (or both) of any type of first trimester abortion procedure, administered by any type of mid‐level provider or doctors, were eligible for inclusion in the review. Data collection and analysis Two independent review authors screened abstracts for eligibility and double‐extracted data from the included studies using a pre‐tested form. We meta‐analysed primary outcome data using both fixed‐effect and random‐effects models to obtain pooled risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We carried out separate analyses by study design (RCT or cohort) and type of abortion procedure (medical versus surgical). Main results Eight studies involving 22,018 participants met our eligibility criteria. Five studies (n = 18,962) assessed the safety and effectiveness of surgical abortion procedures administered by mid‐level providers compared to doctors. Three studies (n = 3056) assessed the safety and effectiveness of medical abortion procedures. The surgical abortion studies (one RCT and four cohort studies) were carried out in the United States, India, South Africa and Vietnam. The medical abortion studies (two RCTs and one cohort study) were carried out in India, Sweden and Nepal. The studies included women with gestational ages up to 14 weeks for surgical abortion and nine weeks for medical abortion. Risk of selection bias was considered to be low in the three RCTs, unclear in four observational studies and high in one observational study. Concealment bias was considered to be low in the three RCTs and high in all five observational studies. Although none of the eight studies performed blinding of the participants to the provider type, we considered the performance bias to be low as this is part of the intervention. Detection bias was considered to be high in all eight studies as none of the eight studies preformed blinding of the outcome assessment. Attrition bias was low in seven studies and high in one, with over 20% attrition. We considered six studies to have unclear risk of selective reporting bias as their protocols had not been published. The remaining two studies had published their protocols. Few other sources of bias were found. Based on an analysis of three cohort studies, the risk of surgical abortion failure was significantly higher when provided by mid‐level providers than when procedures were administered by doctors (RR 2.25, 95% CI 1.38 to 3.68) ,  however the quality of evidence for this outcome was deemed to be very low. For surgical abortion procedures, we found no significant differences in the risk of complications between mid‐level providers and doctors (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.17 to 5.70 from RCTs; RR 1.38, 95% CI 0.70 to 2.72 from observational studies). When we combined the data for failure and complications for surgical abortion we found no significant differences between mid‐level providers and doctors in both the observational study analysis (RR 1.36, 95% CI 0.86 to 2.14) and the RCT analysis (RR 3.07, 95% CI 0.16 to 59.08). The quality of evidence of the outcome for RCT studies was considered to be low and for observational studies very low. For medical abortion procedures the risk of failure was not different for mid‐level providers or doctors (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.36 from RCTs; RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.88 from observational studies). The quality of evidence of this outcome for the RCT analysis was considered to be high, although the quality of evidence of the observational studies was considered to be very low. There were no complications reported in the three medical abortion studies. Authors' conclusions There was no statistically significant difference in the risk of failure for medical abortions performed by mid‐level providers compared with doctors. Observational data indicate that there may be a higher risk of abortion failure for surgical abortion procedures administered by mid‐level providers, but the number of studies is small and more robust data from controlled trials are needed. There were no statistically significant differences in the risk of complications for first trimester surgical abortions performed by mid‐level providers compared with doctors. Plain language summary Can health care providers who are not doctors perform abortions as well as doctors? Unsafe abortion causes death and disability and remains a major public health concern in developing countries. Most of these deaths and disabilities could be prevented if safe and legal abortion were provided by trained people. This review looked at whether using mid‐level providers (health care providers who are not doctors) to perform abortions is safe. It also looked at whether the abortions provided by mid‐level providers worked as well as those provided by doctors. We carried out searches for studies that compared medical abortion (using pills) or surgical abortion provided by either mid‐level providers or doctors. We also wrote to researchers to find more studies. The studies could compare how safe the abortions were or how effective they were (whether they actually worked).  T he evidence we found is up to date as of the 15 th  of August 2014. We found eight studies with a total of 22,018 participants. Five studies compared surgical abortion provided by doctors or mid‐level providers and three studies compared medical abortion provided by doctors or mid‐level providers. Of the five surgical abortion studies only one had a high‐quality study design. Of the three medical abortion studies, two had a high‐quality study design. Three of these studies were carried out in America, two in India, one in was carried out in both South Africa and Vietnam the remaining two were from Sweden and Nepal. The results from the analyses of the medical abortion studies showed that there does not seem to be an advantage when these are provided by doctors. The results from most of the analyses of the surgical abortion studies showed that we cannot be sure that there is a difference in how safe and how effective mid‐level providers are compared to doctors. One analysis of three low‐quality studies of surgical abortion showed that there was more chance of the abortion being ineffective if it was provided by mid‐level providers. Most of the studies did not show a difference between mid‐level providers and doctors in how safe the abortions were and how well they worked. Training mid‐level providers to give medical or surgical abortions could reduce the number of deaths and the disability caused by unsafe abortion. Studies in the future should focus on what types of mid‐level providers can provide safe and effective abortions. They should also look at whether mid‐level providers are as safe and effective as doctors for providing abortions in rural developing country settings.","7","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","Abortifacient Agents; Abortion, Legal [*adverse effects, education, standards]; Abortion, Therapeutic [*adverse effects, education, standards]; Allied Health Personnel [education, *standards]; Clinical Competence [*standards]; Cohort Studies; Female; Humans; Midwifery [education, standards]; Mifepristone; Misoprostol; Nurses [*standards]; Nursing Assistants [education, standards]; Observational Studies as Topic; Physician Assistants [education, standards]; Physicians [*standards]; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Trimester, First; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Vacuum Curettage [adverse effects]","10.1002/14651858.CD011242.pub2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD011242.pub2","Fertility Regulation"

Reminders may help clinicians overcome these problems by prompting them to recall information that they already know or would be expected to know and by providing information or guidance in a more accessible and relevant format, at a particularly appropriate time. This is an update of a previously published review. Objectives To evaluate the effects of reminders automatically generated through a computerized system (computer‐generated) and delivered on paper to healthcare professionals on quality of care (outcomes related to healthcare professionals' practice) and patient outcomes (outcomes related to patients' health condition). Search methods We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, six other databases and two trials registers up to 21 September 2016 together with reference checking, citation searching and contact with study authors to identify additional studies. Selection criteria We included individual‐ or cluster‐randomized and non‐randomized trials that evaluated the impact of computer‐generated reminders delivered on paper to healthcare professionals, alone (single‐component intervention) or in addition to one or more co‐interventions (multi‐component intervention), compared with usual care or the co‐intervention(s) without the reminder component. Data collection and analysis Review authors working in pairs independently screened studies for eligibility and abstracted data. For each study, we extracted the primary outcome when it was defined or calculated the median effect size across all reported outcomes. We then calculated the median improvement and interquartile range (IQR) across included studies using the primary outcome or median outcome as representative outcome. We assessed the certainty of the evidence according to the GRADE approach. Main results We identified 35 studies (30 randomized trials and five non‐randomized trials) and analyzed 34 studies (40 comparisons). Twenty‐nine studies took place in the USA and six studies took place in Canada, France, Israel, and Kenya. All studies except two took place in outpatient care. Reminders were aimed at enhancing compliance with preventive guidelines (e.g. cancer screening tests, vaccination) in half the studies and at enhancing compliance with disease management guidelines for acute or chronic conditions (e.g. annual follow‐ups, laboratory tests, medication adjustment, counseling) in the other half. Computer‐generated reminders delivered on paper to healthcare professionals, alone or in addition to co‐intervention(s), probably improves quality of care slightly compared with usual care or the co‐intervention(s) without the reminder component (median improvement 6.8% (IQR: 3.8% to 17.5%); 34 studies (40 comparisons); moderate‐certainty evidence). Computer‐generated reminders delivered on paper to healthcare professionals alone (single‐component intervention) probably improves quality of care compared with usual care (median improvement 11.0% (IQR 5.4% to 20.0%); 27 studies (27 comparisons); moderate‐certainty evidence). Adding computer‐generated reminders delivered on paper to healthcare professionals to one or more co‐interventions (multi‐component intervention) probably improves quality of care slightly compared with the co‐intervention(s) without the reminder component (median improvement 4.0% (IQR 3.0% to 6.0%); 11 studies (13 comparisons); moderate‐certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether reminders, alone or in addition to co‐intervention(s), improve patient outcomes as the certainty of the evidence is very low (n = 6 studies (seven comparisons)). None of the included studies reported outcomes related to harms or adverse effects of the intervention. Authors' conclusions There is moderate‐certainty evidence that computer‐generated reminders delivered on paper to healthcare professionals probably slightly improves quality of care, in terms of compliance with preventive guidelines and compliance with disease management guidelines. It is uncertain whether reminders improve patient outcomes because the certainty of the evidence is very low. The heterogeneity of the reminder interventions included in this review also suggests that reminders can probably improve quality of care in various settings under various conditions. Plain language summary The effect of automatically generated reminders delivered to providers on paper on quality of care and patient outcomes What is the aim of this review? The aim of this Cochrane review was to find out if reminders, automatically generated through a computer, but delivered on paper to doctors help them provide the best recommended care. Cochrane researchers identified 35 studies and analyzed 34 of these studies to answer this question. Key messages Providing reminders to doctors probably improves slightly the quality of care patients receive. However, because the certainty of the evidence is moderate, more high‐quality studies on the effectiveness of reminders are needed to confirm to findings of this review. What was studied in the review? Doctors do not always provide care that is recommended or that reflects the latest research, partly because of too much information or inaccessible information. Reminders may help doctors overcome these problems by reminding them about guidelines and research findings, or by providing advice, in a more accessible and relevant format, at a particularly appropriate time. For example, when a doctor sees a patient for an annual check‐up, the doctor would receive the patient's chart with a reminder section listing the screening tests due that year, such as colorectal cancer screening. In this review, we evaluated the effects of reminders on the quality of care delivered by physicians, on patient outcomes, and on adverse effects. These reminders were automatically generated through a computer system but delivered on paper. What are the main results of the review? Twenty‐nine studies were from the USA and six studies were from Canada, France, Israel and Kenya. The studies examined reminders to doctors to order screening tests, to provide vaccinations, to prescribe specific medications, or to discuss care with patients. The review shows that: ‐ overall, reminders probably improve slightly quality of care by 6.8% (in 34 studies (40 comparisons), moderate‐certainty evidence); ‐ reminders alone (single‐component intervention) probably improve quality of care by 11.0% compared with usual care (in 27 studies (27 comparisons), moderate‐certainty evidence); ‐ adding reminders to one or more co‐interventions (multi‐component intervention) probably improve slightly quality of care by 4.0% compared with the co‐intervention(s) without the reminder component (in 11 studies (13 comparisons), moderate‐certainty evidence); ‐ it is uncertain whether reminders improve patient outcomes because the certainty of the evidence is very low; ‐ none of the included studies reported outcomes related to harms or adverse effects.

With high expectations for healthcare providers to remain up‐to‐date with current evidence and the movement towards formalizing reflective practice as part of physician revalidation, it is important that curricula developed for improving the ability to formulate well‐constructed questions are based on the best evidence. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of interventions for increasing the frequency and quality of questions formulated by healthcare providers in practice and the context of self‐directed learning. Search methods We obtained studies from searches of electronic bibliographic databases, and supplemented these with handsearching, checking reference lists, and consultation with experts. Selection criteria We considered published and unpublished randomized controlled trials (RCTs), controlled clinical trials (CCTs), interrupted time‐series (ITS), and controlled before‐after (CBA) studies of any language examining interventions for increasing the quality and frequency of questions formulated by health professionals involved with direct patient care. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently undertook all relevancy screening and 'Risk of bias' assessment in duplicate. Intervention characteristics, follow‐up intervals, and measurement outcomes were diverse and precluded quantitative analysis. We have summarized data descriptively. Main results Searches identified four studies examining interventions to improve question formulation in healthcare professionals. Interventions were mostly multi‐component, limited within the context of EBM and primarily in physician and resident populations. We did not identify studies examining changes in frequency of questions formulated or those within the context of reflection. Risk of bias was generally rated to be ‘high risk’. Three of the four studies showed improvements in question formulation in physicians, residents, or mixed allied health populations in the short‐ to moderate term follow up. Only one study examined sustainability of effects at one year and reported that skills had eroded over time. Authors' conclusions Evidence from our review suggests that interventions to increase the quality of questions formulated in practice produce mixed results at both short‐ (immediately following intervention), and moderate‐term follow up (up to nine months), comparatively. Although three studies reported effectiveness estimates of an educational intervention for increasing the quality of question formulation within the short term, only one study examined the effectiveness in the longer term (one year) and revealed that search skills had eroded over time. Data suggests that sustainability of effects from educational interventions for question formulation are unknown. Plain language summary Interventions to improve question formulation in professional practice and self‐directed learning Health professionals ask questions as part of their daily practice lives. They can ask questions for a number of reasons including whether or not their knowledge is current (e.g. 'what is the best drug to use for this disease') or to reflect on whether or not they have made the best decision (e.g. 'is there anything else I could have done differently to improve this patient's care?'). We know less about how to increase the number of questions they ask and how to increase the quality of the questions they ask. Questions, and how they are structured, can have an important impact on how healthcare professionals search for information, speak with colleagues, and learn in practice. Health professionals are doctors, nurses, physiotherapists, pharmacists, occupational therapists, and anyone who provides direct patient care. This review shows that there were some small improvements in the quality of questions created by healthcare professionals following some training (and in some cases the use of informational pamphlets), but we are uncertain how long these improvements last over time. With so little information we cannot make specific, or concrete, conclusions. We did not find information that would tell us what interventions are effective for increasing the number of questions asked and we suggest that this should be an area of research in the future.","5","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Professional Practice; Clinical Competence; Education, Continuing; Evidence-Based Medicine [*education]; Health Personnel [*education]; Humans; Problem-Based Learning [*methods, standards]; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic","10.1002/14651858.CD007335.pub2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD007335.pub2","Effective Practice and Organisation of Care"
"CD001174.PUB4","Pantoja, T; Grimshaw, JM; Colomer, N; Castañon, C; Leniz Martelli, J","Manually‐generated reminders delivered on paper: effects on professional practice and patient outcomes","Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","2019","Abstract - Background Health professionals sometimes do not use the best evidence to treat their patients, in part due to unconscious acts of omission and information overload. Reminders help clinicians overcome these problems by prompting them to recall information that they already know, or by presenting information in a different and more accessible format. Manually‐generated reminders delivered on paper are defined as information given to the health professional with each patient or encounter, provided on paper, in which no computer is involved in the production or delivery of the reminder. Manually‐generated reminders delivered on paper are relatively cheap interventions, and are especially relevant in settings where electronic clinical records are not widely available and affordable. This review is one of three Cochrane Reviews focused on the effectiveness of reminders in health care. Objectives 1. To determine the effectiveness of manually‐generated reminders delivered on paper in changing professional practice and improving patient outcomes.  2. To explore whether a number of potential effect modifiers influence the effectiveness of manually‐generated reminders delivered on paper. Search methods We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and two trials registers on 5 December 2018. We searched grey literature, screened individual journals, conference proceedings and relevant systematic reviews, and reviewed reference lists and cited references of included studies. Selection criteria We included randomised and non‐randomised trials assessing the impact of manually‐generated reminders delivered on paper as a single intervention (compared with usual care) or added to one or more co‐interventions as a multicomponent intervention (compared with the co‐intervention(s) without the reminder component) on professional practice or patients' outcomes. We also included randomised and non‐randomised trials comparing manually‐generated reminders with other quality improvement (QI) interventions. Data collection and analysis Two review authors screened studies for eligibility and abstracted data independently. We extracted the primary outcome as defined by the authors or calculated the median effect size across all reported outcomes in each study. We then calculated the median percentage improvement and interquartile range across the included studies that reported improvement related outcomes, and assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. Main results We identified 63 studies (41 cluster‐randomised trials, 18 individual randomised trials, and four non‐randomised trials) that met all inclusion criteria. Fifty‐seven studies reported usable data (64 comparisons). The studies were mainly located in North America (42 studies) and the UK (eight studies). Fifty‐four studies took place in outpatient/ambulatory settings. The clinical areas most commonly targeted were cardiovascular disease management (11 studies), cancer screening (10 studies) and preventive care (10 studies), and most studies had physicians as their target population (57 studies). General management of a clinical condition (17 studies), test‐ordering (14 studies) and prescription (10 studies) were the behaviours more commonly targeted by the intervention. Forty‐eight studies reported changes in professional practice measured as dichotomous process adherence outcomes (e.g. compliance with guidelines recommendations), 16 reported those changes measured as continuous process‐of‐care outcomes (e.g. number of days with catheters), eight reported dichotomous patient outcomes (e.g. mortality rates) and five reported continuous patient outcomes (e.g. mean systolic blood pressure). Manually‐generated reminders delivered on paper probably improve professional practice measured as dichotomous process adherence outcomes) compared with usual care (median improvement 8.45% (IQR 2.54% to 20.58%); 39 comparisons, 40,346 participants; moderate certainty of evidence) and may make little or no difference to continuous process‐of‐care outcomes (8 comparisons, 3263 participants; low certainty of evidence). Adding manually‐generated paper reminders to one or more QI co‐interventions may slightly improve professional practice measured as dichotomous process adherence outcomes (median improvement 4.24% (IQR −1.09% to 5.50%); 12 comparisons, 25,359 participants; low certainty of evidence) and probably slightly improve professional practice measured as continuous outcomes (median improvement 0.28 (IQR 0.04 to 0.51); 2 comparisons, 12,372 participants; moderate certainty of evidence). Compared with other QI interventions, manually‐generated reminders may slightly decrease professional practice measured as process adherence outcomes (median decrease 7.9% (IQR −0.7% to 11%); 14 comparisons, 21,274 participants; low certainty of evidence). We are uncertain whether manually‐generated reminders delivered on paper, compared with usual care or with other QI intervention, lead to better or worse patient outcomes (dichotomous or continuous), as the certainty of the evidence is very low (10 studies, 13 comparisons). Reminders added to other QI interventions may make little or no difference to patient outcomes (dichotomous or continuous) compared with the QI alone (2 studies, 2 comparisons). Regarding resource use, studies reported additional costs per additional point of effectiveness gained, but because of the different currencies and years used the relevance of those figures is uncertain. None of the included studies reported outcomes related to harms or adverse effects. Authors' conclusions Manually‐generated reminders delivered on paper as a single intervention probably lead to small to moderate increases in outcomes related to adherence to clinical recommendations, and they could be used as a single QI intervention. It is uncertain whether reminders should be added to other QI intervention already in place in the health system, although the effects may be positive. If other QI interventions, such as patient or computerised reminders, are available, they should be preferred over manually‐generated reminders, but under close evaluation in order to decrease uncertainty about their potential effect. Plain language summary The effect of manually‐generated reminders delivered to providers on paper on professional practice and patient outcomes What is the aim of this review? In this Cochrane Review we aimed to find out if health workers who are given reminders on paper give better health care. The reminders contained information about the patients, for instance recommendation to measure blood pressure. We collected and analysed all relevant studies and found 63 studies. Key messages It seems likely that providing reminders to health workers probably leads to small‐to‐moderate improvements in their practice measured as adherence to clinical recommendations. It is uncertain whether providing reminders has an effect on patient outcomes. What was studied in the review? Health workers do not always provide care that is recommended by clinical guidelines or standards, because of too much information or unconscious forgetfulness. One possible solution is to give them paper reminders that were not created by a computer. These are particularly important in countries where electronic records are not widely available. Reminders may help health workers overcome those problems by prompting them to follow clinical recommendations in guidelines or by providing information in a simple and timely way. In this review we evaluated the effects of reminders generated manually and delivered on paper on professional practice and patient outcomes. What are the main results of the review? We identified 63 studies and included 57 in our analysis. The studies evaluated reminders aimed at ordering screening tests, providing vaccinations, prescribing specific medications, or discussing care with patients. The studies show that: ‐ reminders alone (single‐component intervention) probably improve professional practice, measured as compliance with recommendations, compared with usual care; ‐ reminders added to one or more co‐interventions (multicomponent intervention) may slightly improve professional practice, measured as compliance with recommendations, compared with the co‐intervention(s) without the reminder component; ‐ reminders may lead to slightly worse professional practice than other interventions for quality improvement, such as patients reminders; ‐ it is uncertain whether reminders compared with usual care or other quality‐improvement interventions improve patient outcomes; ‐ reminders added to other quality‐improvement interventions may make little or no difference to patient outcomes compared with the quality intervention alone; ‐ there were additional costs to obtain the effects described above, but the relevance of the figures presented was uncertain; ‐ none of the included studies reported outcomes related to harms or adverse effects.

It demands health and social care professionals collaborate in an effective manner. Research continues to suggest that collaboration between these professionals can be problematic. Interprofessional education (IPE) offers a possible way to improve interprofessional collaboration and patient care. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of IPE interventions compared to separate, profession‐specific education interventions; and to assess the effectiveness of IPE interventions compared to no education intervention. Search methods For this update we searched the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care Group specialised register, MEDLINE and CINAHL, for the years 2006 to 2011. We also handsearched the  Journal of Interprofessional Care  (2006 to 2011), reference lists of all included studies, the proceedings of leading IPE conferences, and websites of IPE organisations.  Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), controlled before and after (CBA) studies and interrupted time series (ITS) studies of IPE interventions that reported objectively measured or self reported (validated instrument) patient/client or healthcare process outcomes. Data collection and analysis At least two review authors independently assessed the eligibility of potentially relevant studies. For included studies, at least two review authors extracted data and assessed study quality. A meta‐analysis of study outcomes was not possible due to heterogeneity in study designs and outcome measures. Consequently, the results are presented in a narrative format. Main results This update located nine new studies, which were added to the six studies from our last update in 2008. This review now includes 15 studies (eight RCTs, five CBA and two ITS studies). All of these studies measured the effectiveness of IPE interventions compared to no educational intervention. Seven studies indicated that IPE produced positive outcomes in the following areas: diabetes care, emergency department culture and patient satisfaction; collaborative team behaviour and reduction of clinical error rates for emergency department teams; collaborative team behaviour in operating rooms; management of care delivered in cases of domestic violence; and mental health practitioner competencies related to the delivery of patient care. In addition, four of the studies reported mixed outcomes (positive and neutral) and four studies reported that the IPE interventions had no impact on either professional practice or patient care. Authors' conclusions This updated review reports on 15 studies that met the inclusion criteria (nine studies from this update and six studies from the 2008 update). Although these studies reported some positive outcomes, due to the small number of studies and the heterogeneity of interventions and outcome measures, it is not possible to draw generalisable inferences about the key elements of IPE and its effectiveness. To improve the quality of evidence relating to IPE and patient outcomes or healthcare process outcomes, the following three gaps will need to be filled: first, studies that assess the effectiveness of IPE interventions compared to separate, profession‐specific interventions; second, RCT, CBA or ITS studies with qualitative strands examining processes relating to the IPE and practice changes; third, cost‐benefit analyses. Plain language summary Training health and social care professionals to work together effectively Interprofessional education (IPE) is defined as an intervention where the members of more than one health or social care profession, or both, learn interactively together, for the explicit purpose of improving interprofessional collaboration or the health/well being of patients/clients, or both. This review evaluated the effectiveness of IPE compared to educational interventions in which different professional groups were learning separately from one another and IPE compared with interventions in which no IPE was offered to a comparison group. This review was restricted to studies that measured patient outcomes or healthcare processes. This excluded qualitative studies and quantitative studies that reported on the impact that IPE can have on participants' attitudes, knowledge and skills of collaboration. This does not imply that qualitative studies and those focused on attitudes, knowledge and skills do not offer useful insights for certain purposes; simply that they are not the focus of this review. Nine studies met the inclusion criteria for the review. These studies were added to the six that we found the last time we updated the review, bringing the total to 15 studies. Seven of these studies reported positive outcomes for healthcare processes or patient outcomes, or both, four studies reported mixed outcomes (positive and neutral) and four reported no effects of IPE. The studies differed in many respects. They were conducted in different areas of clinical practice and included different IPE interventions. The study designs and outcome measures were also different. All 15 studies compared outcomes following an IPE intervention to outcomes, either in similar clinical settings that did not receive the IPE intervention, or in the same clinical setting before the intervention was made. Because no studies compared an interprofessional intervention to a profession‐specific intervention, our understanding of interprofessional interventions is limited. The small number of studies included in this review, and their varied nature, limit our understanding of the key components of IPE and its effectiveness. More studies are needed to allow sound conclusions to be reached about the effectiveness of IPE, as well as to inform IPE policy development. In particular, these should include: first, studies that assess the effectiveness of IPE interventions compared to separate, profession‐specific interventions; second, RCT, CBA or ITS studies with qualitative strands examining processes relating to the IPE and practice changes; third, cost‐benefit analyses.","3","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Interprofessional Relations; *Patient Care; *Patient Care Team; *Professional Practice; Attitude of Health Personnel; Health Personnel [*education]; Humans; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Treatment Outcome","10.1002/14651858.CD002213.pub3","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD002213.pub3","Effective Practice and Organisation of Care"

Simulation‐based obstetric team training has been proposed as a tool to improve the overall outcome of obstetric health care. Objectives To assess the effects of simulation‐based obstetric team training on patient outcomes, performance of obstetric care teams in practice and educational settings, and trainees' experience. Search methods The Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register,  ClinicalTrials.gov  and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform ( ICTRP ) were searched (14 April 2020), together with references checking and hand searching the available proceedings of 2 international conferences. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) (including cluster‐randomised trials) comparing simulation‐based obstetric team training with no, or other type of training. Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane, to identify articles, assess methodological quality and extract data. Data from three cluster‐randomised trials could be used to perform generic inverse variance meta‐analyses. The meta‐analyses were based on risk ratios (RRs) and mean differences (MDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We used the GRADE approach to rate the certainty of the evidence. We used Kirkpatrick's model of training evaluation to categorise the outcomes of interest; we chose Level 3 (behavioural change) and Level 4 (patient outcome) to categorise the primary outcomes. Main results We included eight RCTs, six of which were cluster‐randomised trials, involving more than 1000 training participants and more than 200,000 pregnancies/births. Four studies reported on outcome measures on Kirkpatrick level 4 (patient outcome), three studies on Kirkpatrick level 3 (performance in practice), two studies on Kitkpatrick level 2 (performance in educational settings), and none on Kirkpatrick level 1 (trainees' experience). The included studies were from Mexico, the Netherlands, the UK and the USA, all middle‐ and high‐income countries. Kirkpatrick level 4 (patient outcome) Simulation‐based obstetric team training may make little or no difference for composite outcomes of maternal and/or perinatal adverse events compared with no training (3 studies; n = 28,731, low‐certainty evidence, data not pooled due to different composite outcome definitions). We are uncertain whether simulation‐based obstetric team training affects maternal mortality compared with no training (2 studies; 79,246 women; very low‐certainty evidence). However, it may reduce neonatal mortality (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.01; 2 studies, 79,246 pregnancies/births, low‐certainty evidence). Simulation‐based obstetric team training may have little to no effect on low Apgar score compared with no training (RR 0.99, 95% 0.85 to 1.15; 2 studies; 115,171 infants; low‐certainty evidence), but it probably reduces trauma after shoulder dystocia (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.99; 1 study; moderate‐certainty evidence) and probably slightly reduces the number of caesarean deliveries (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.93; 1 study; n = 50,589; moderate‐certainty evidence) Kirkpatrick level 3 (performance in practice) We found that simulation‐based obstetric team training probably improves the performance of the obstetric teams in practice, compared with no training (3 studies; 2398 obstetric staff members, moderate‐certainty evidence, data not pooled due to different outcome definitions). Authors' conclusions Simulation‐based obstetric team training may help to improve team performance of obstetric teams, and it might contribute to improvement of specific maternal and perinatal outcomes, compared with no training. However, high‐certainty evidence is lacking due to serious risk of bias and imprecision, and the effect cannot be generalised for all outcomes. Future studies investigating simulation‐based obstetric team training compared to training courses with a different instructional design should carefully consider how and when to measure outcomes. Particular attention should be paid to effect measurement at the level of patient outcome, taking into consideration the low incidence of adverse maternal and perinatal events. Plain language summary Simulation‐based obstetric team training to improve the overall outcome of obstetric health care To determine the effect of simulation‐based obstetric team training on patient outcomes, performance of the obstetric care team in practice and educational settings, and trainees' experience, when compared to no training or another type of training. What is the issue? Obstetric emergencies are pregnancy‐related conditions that can threaten the well‐being of mother and baby in pregnancy or around birth. These emergencies can happen at any time, result in high‐level pressure with high‐stakes decisions, and technical and ethical challenges of caring for both the mother and her child. Organisational and human factors are considered to be major sources of preventable, substandard care. Simulation‐based team training focuses on building a system that will anticipate errors, improve patient outcomes and the performance of obstetric care teams. Why is this important? Adequate performance of the obstetric care team is essential for safe management of obstetric emergencies. Inadequate performance of care teams can lead to substandard care resulting in poor outcomes for mothers and their children. Simulation‐based obstetric team training has been recommended to improve the overall outcome and quality of obstetric health care. Its effectiveness needs to be evaluated. What evidence did we find? The search was performed in April 2020. We identified eight randomised studies. Six cluster‐randomised studies compared simulation‐based obstetric team training with no training. Kirkpatrick level 4 (patient outcome):  simulation‐based obstetric team training may make little or no difference for a combination of adverse events in the mother or the infant. We are uncertain whether simulation‐based obstetric team training affects the risk of death for the mother. However, it may reduce the risk of death for the newborn baby. Simulation‐based obstetric team training may have little to no effect on low Apgar score but it probably reduces trauma after shoulder dystocia and probably slightly reduces the number of caesarean deliveries. Kirkpatrick level 3 (performance in practice):  we found that simulation‐based obstetric team training probably improves the performance of the obstetric teams in practice. What does this mean? Simulation‐based obstetric team training might be helpful for the improvement of team performance and specific maternal and perinatal outcomes. High‐certainty evidence was lacking due to limitations in the way the studies were designed and conducted. Six studies were performed in high‐income countries (the Netherlands, the UK, and the USA), and two studies were performed in a middle‐income country (Mexico).This meant that we could not combine all the data to reach robust conclusions. Future studies investigating simulation‐based obstetric team training compared to different designs of training courses should carefully consider how and when to measure the effects of the interventions.","12","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","Apgar Score; Bias; Cesarean Section [statistics & numerical data]; Clinical Competence; Confidence Intervals; Emergencies; Female; Humans; Infant; Infant Mortality; Infant, Newborn; Maternal Mortality; Medical Errors [prevention & control]; Obstetrics [*education]; Patient Care Team [*organization & administration]; Pregnancy; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Shoulder Dystocia [epidemiology]; Simulation Training [*methods]; Treatment Outcome","10.1002/14651858.CD011545.pub2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD011545.pub2","Pregnancy and Childbirth"

It is often poorly performed in practice. Various interventions have been developed that aim to enhance communication involving children or adolescents with cancer. Objectives To assess the effects of interventions for improving communication with children and/or adolescents about their cancer, its treatment and their implications, updating the 2003 version of this review. Search methods In April 2006 we updated searches of the following sources: CENTRAL ( The Cochrane Library , issue 1 2006); MEDLINE (Ovid), (2003 to March week 5 2006); EMBASE (Ovid) (2003 to 2006 week 13); PsycINFO (Ovid) (2003 to March week 5 2006); CINAHL (Ovid) (2003 to March week 5 2006); ERIC (CSA) (earliest to 2006); Sociological Abstracts (CSA) (earliest to 2006); Dissertation Abstracts: (2002 to 6 April 2006). In 2003 we conducted searches of CENTRAL; MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, ERIC, Sociological Abstracts and Dissertation Abstracts. For the initial (2001) publication of this review we also searched the following databases: PsycLIT; Cancerlit; Sociofile; Health Management Information Consortium; ASSIA; LISA; PAIS; Information Science Abstracts; JICST; Pascal; Linguistics and Language Behavior Abstracts; Mental Health Abstracts; AMED; MANTIS. We also searched the bibliographies of studies assessed for inclusion, and contacted experts in the field. Selection criteria Randomised and non‐randomised controlled trials, and before and after studies, evaluating the effects of interventions for improving communication with children and/or adolescents about their cancer, treatment and related issues. Data collection and analysis Data relating to the interventions, populations and outcomes studied and the design and methodological quality of included studies were extracted by one review author and checked by another review author. We present a narrative summary of the results. Main results One new study met the criteria for inclusion; in total we have included ten studies involving 438 participants. Studies were diverse in terms of the interventions evaluated, study designs used, types of people who participated and the outcomes measured. One study of a computer‐assisted education programme reported improvements in knowledge and understanding about blood counts and cancer symptoms. One study of a CD‐ROM about leukaemia reported an improvement in children's feelings of control over their health. One study of art therapy as support for children during painful procedures reported an increase in positive, collaborative behaviour. Two out of two studies of school reintegration programs reported improvements in some aspects of psychosocial wellbeing (one in anxiety and one in depression), social wellbeing (two in social competence and one in social support) and behavioural problems; and one reported improvements in physical competence. One newly‐identified study of a multifaceted interactive intervention reported a reduction in distress (as measured by heart rate) related to radiation therapy. Two studies of group therapy, one of planned play and story telling, and one of a self‐care coping intervention, found no significant effects on the psychological or clinical outcomes measured. Authors' conclusions Interventions to enhance communication involving children and adolescents with cancer have not been widely or rigorously assessed. The weak evidence that exists suggests that some children and adolescents with cancer may derive some benefit from specific information‐giving programs, from support before and during particular procedures, and from interventions that aim to facilitate their reintegration into school and social activities. More research is needed to investigate the effects of these and other related interventions. Plain language summary Ways of improving communication with children and adolescents about their cancer Communicating about cancer may help some children and adolescents understand the disease and its treatment and help them cope better with their cancer. Children and adolescents with cancer face many issues and may benefit from greater opportunities to talk to health professionals. Concerns about their illness and its treatment can result in psychological, behavioural and developmental problems. Various methods of communication have been designed to provide better access to the knowledge and understanding these children and adolescents require. The review of trials found that specific information‐giving programs, support before and during particular procedures, and school reintegration programs may benefit children and adolescents with cancer when individual factors such as their age, level of understanding and medical condition have been considered. More research is needed.","4","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Communication; *Neoplasms [psychology, therapy]; *Patient Education as Topic; Adolescent; Child; Clinical Trials as Topic; Family; Humans; Professional‐Patient Relations","10.1002/14651858.CD002969.pub2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD002969.pub2","Consumers and Communication"

Many caregivers, however, find themselves in a caring role for which they are ill prepared and may require professional support. The telephone is an easily accessible method of providing support irrespective of geographical location. Objectives The objective of this review was to evaluate the effectiveness of telephone support interventions, delivered by healthcare professionals, when compared to usual care or non‐telephone‐based support interventions for providing education and psychosocial support for informal caregivers of people with acute and chronic diagnosed illnesses, and to evaluate the cost‐effectiveness of telephone interventions in this population. Search methods We searched the following databases from inception to 16 November 2018: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); MEDLINE; Embase; PsycINFO; ProQuest Dissertations and Theses A&I; and CINAHL Complete. We also searched 11 caregiver‐specific websites, three conference links, and two clinical trial registries. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) (including cluster‐RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs. We excluded cross‐over trials because of the high risk of carry‐over effects from one intervention to another. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently screened citations against the review's inclusion criteria, extracted data, and assessed the included studies using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool. The review's prespecified primary (quality of life and burden) and secondary outcomes (skill acquisition, psychological health, knowledge, health status and well‐being, family functioning, satisfaction, and economic outcomes), where reported, were assessed at the end of intervention delivery and at short‐term (≤ 3 months), medium‐term (> 3 to ≤ 6 months) and longer‐term time points (> 6 to 12 months) following the intervention. Where possible, meta‐analyses were conducted, otherwise results were reported narratively. Main results We included 21 randomised studies involving 1,690 caregivers; 19 studies compared telephone support interventions and usual care, of which 18 contributed data to the analyses. Two studies compared telephone and non‐telephone professional support interventions. Caregiver ages ranged from 19 years to 87 years across studies. The majority of participants were female (> 70.53%), with two trials including females only. Most caregivers were family members, educated beyond secondary or high school level or had the equivalent in years of education. All caregivers were based in the community. Overall risk of bias was high for most studies. The results demonstrated that there is probably little or no difference between telephone support interventions and usual care for the primary outcome of quality of life at the end of intervention (SMD ‐0.02, 95% CI ‐0.24 to 0.19, 4 studies, 364 caregivers) (moderate‐certainty evidence) or burden at the end of intervention (SMD ‐0.11, 95% CI ‐0.30 to 0.07, 9 studies, 788 caregivers) (low‐certainty evidence). For one study where quality of life at the end of intervention was reported narratively, the findings indicated that a telephone support intervention may result in slightly higher quality of life, compared with usual care. Two further studies on caregiver burden were reported narratively; one reported that telephone support interventions may decrease burden, the other reported no change in the intervention group, compared with usual care. We are uncertain about the effects of telephone support interventions on caregiver depression at the end of intervention (SMD ‐0.37, 95% CI ‐0.70 to ‐0.05, 9 studies, 792 caregivers) due to very low‐certainty evidence for this outcome. Depression was reported narratively for three studies. One reported that the intervention may reduce caregiver depression at the end of intervention, but this effect was not sustained at short‐term follow‐up. The other two studies reported there may be little or no difference between telephone support and usual care for depression at the end of intervention. Six studies measured satisfaction with the intervention but did not report comparative data. All six reported high satisfaction scores with the intervention. No adverse events, including suicide or suicide ideation, were measured or reported by any of the included studies. Our analysis indicated that caregiver anxiety may be slightly reduced (MD ‐6.0, 95% CI ‐11.68 to ‐0.32, 1 study, 61 caregivers) and preparedness to care slightly improved (SMD 0.37, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.64, 2 studies, 208 caregivers) at the end of intervention, following telephone‐only support interventions compared to usual care. Findings indicated there may be little or no difference between telephone support interventions and usual care for all of the following outcomes at the end of intervention: problem‐solving, social activity, caregiver competence, coping, stress, knowledge, physical health, self‐efficacy, family functioning, and satisfaction with supports (practical or social). There may also be little or no effect of telephone support interventions for quality of life and burden at short‐term follow‐up or for burden and depression at medium‐term follow‐up. Litttle or no difference was found between groups for any of the reported outcomes in studies comparing telephone and non‐telephone professional support interventions. We are uncertain as to the effects of telephone support interventions compared to non‐telephone support interventions for caregiver burden and depression at the end of intervention. No study reported on quality of life or satisfaction with the intervention and no adverse events were reported or noted in the two studies reporting on this comparison. Authors' conclusions Although our review indicated slight benefit may exist for telephone support interventions on some outcomes (e.g. anxiety and preparedness to care at the end of intervention), for most outcomes, including the primary outcomes, telephone‐only interventions may have little or no effect on caregiver outcomes compared to usual care. The findings of the review were mainly based on studies with overall high risk of bias, and few participants. Further high‐quality trials, with larger sample sizes are required. Plain language summary [Telephone interventions for providing education and psychosocial support to caregivers]   Background Caregivers providing care to a family member, friend, or neighbour experience the role in differing ways. Some caregivers may find themselves in a caring role for which they are ill prepared and professional support is essential. This review examined whether telephone support interventions delivered by healthcare professionals had positive benefits on a range of outcomes including quality of life, burden (the experience of strain or load), skill acquisition (e.g. problem‐solving), psychological health (e.g. depression), knowledge, physical health, family functioning, satisfaction, or cost, for unpaid caregivers in the community. A telephone support intervention is one that is delivered via the telephone and designed to provide knowledge, advice, or help to caregivers to enable them to manage their own well‐being or that of the person they care for. It is an easily accessible method of providing support irrespective of geographical location. Studies that compared telephone support to usual care or to non‐telephone‐based professional support interventions were included. Study characteristics We included 21 studies involving 1,690 caregivers caring for persons with a range of diagnosed conditions. Caregiver ages ranged from 19 years to 87 years. Most were female and caring for a family member. The majority were spouses, in particular wives, except for one study that mainly focused on adult children. Most caregivers had greater than secondary school education. Eighteen studies reported funding from reputable sources. Key results Nineteen studies (18 studies contributing data) compared telephone support interventions and usual care. Telephone support interventions probably have little or no effect on caregiver quality of life (4 studies, 364 caregivers) and may have little effect on burden (9 studies, 788 caregivers) compared to usual care on completion of the intervention. Although anxiety may be slightly reduced and preparedness to care slightly improved following the intervention, we are uncertain about the effects on depression and overall, telephone interventions may have little or no effect on the outcomes assessed by this review. High satisfaction with the intervention was reported in six studies that measured this outcome, but no comparative data from usual care groups was reported. Two studies compared telephone and non‐telephone‐based support interventions. There may be little or no evidence of an effect of telephone support when compared non‐telephone‐based support interventions for any reported outcome. No adverse events were measured or reported in any of the included studies. Quality of evidence The quality of the evidence was assessed as very low to moderate across outcomes, thus reducing confidence in the findings. Many of the results were based on data from single studies with few participants. Larger well‐designed studies are required to determine the effects of telephone support interventions.","5","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Chronic Disease [psychology]; *Psychosocial Support Systems; *Telephone; Adaptation, Psychological; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Anxiety [psychology]; Caregivers [*psychology]; Depression [psychology]; Family; Female; Humans; Male; Mental Health; Middle Aged; Quality of Life; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Stress, Psychological [*psychology]; Young Adult","10.1002/14651858.CD012533.pub2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD012533.pub2","Consumers and Communication"

Objectives To assess the effectiveness of interventions aimed at increasing the proportion of health professionals working in rural and other underserved areas. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, including specialised register of the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care Group; March 2014), MEDLINE (1966 to March 2014), EMBASE (1988 to March 2014), CINAHL (1982 to March 2014), LILACS (February 2014), Science Citation Index and Social Sciences Citation Index (up to April 2014), Global Health (March 2014) and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (June 2013). We also searched reference lists of all papers and relevant reviews identified, and contacted authors of relevant papers regarding any further published or unpublished work. Selection criteria Randomised trials, non‐randomised trials, controlled before‐and‐after studies and interrupted time series studies evaluating the effects of various interventions (e.g. educational, financial, regulatory or support strategies) on the recruitment or retention, or both, of health professionals in underserved areas. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently screened titles and abstracts and assessed full texts of potentially relevant studies for eligibility. Two review authors independently extracted data from eligible studies. Main results For this first update of the original review, we screened 8945 records for eligibility. We retrieved and assessed the full text of 125 studies. Only one study met the inclusion criteria of the review. This interrupted time series study, conducted in Taiwan, found that the implementation of a National Health Insurance scheme in 1995 was associated with improved equity in the geographic distribution of physicians and dentists. We judged the certainty of the evidence provided by this one study very low. Authors' conclusions There is currently limited reliable evidence regarding the effects of interventions aimed at addressing the inequitable distribution of health professionals. Well‐designed studies are needed to confirm or refute findings of observational studies of educational, financial, regulatory and supportive interventions that might influence healthcare professionals' decisions to practice in underserved areas. Governments and medical schools should ensure that when interventions are implemented, their impacts are evaluated using scientifically rigorous methods to establish the true effects of these measures on healthcare professional recruitment and retention in rural and other underserved settings. Plain language summary Interventions for increasing the proportion of health professionals practicing in rural and underserved areas What was the aim of this review? The aim of this Cochrane review was to find out whether strategies to increase the number of health professionals working in rural and underserved areas are effective. Researchers in The Cochrane Collaboration searched for all new studies that could answer this question, given that the previous review done in 2009 did not identify any high certainty evidence. What did the review conclude? We were only able to identify one new study with very low certainty of evidence. Therefore, we remain uncertain about the effects of these types of strategies. Well conducted interventional studies with appropriate control or comparison groups are needed to assess critically the impact of strategies to increase the number of health professionals working in underserved areas. What was studied in the review? All countries have areas that are relatively underserved by health professionals; mostly among rural communities and the urban poor. This problem is seen across the world, but is particularly serious in low‐ and middle‐income countries. While some health professionals choose to work in underserved areas, we need strategies to persuade more of them to do so. Different strategies have been used. For example, some medical schools try to recruit more students with a rural background or arrange for students to practice in rural settings in the hope that graduates will return to those areas to practice. Scholarships, grants, loan repayment schemes and higher salaries have been offered to attract health professionals to underserved areas, while countries also utilise mandatory redeployment strategies. Although some strategies have shown promise, there is a lack of well‐designed studies to measure the short‐term and long‐term effectiveness of these strategies in a rigorous fashion. What are the main results of the review? This review found one new study that evaluated the effect of a National Health Insurance scheme on the distribution of health professionals in Taiwan. Before the implementation of National Health Insurance, people living in rural areas were less able to afford medical costs than their urban counterparts. The implementation of a National Health Insurance scheme made medical care more affordable for all Taiwanese citizens in both urban and rural areas. This may have led to better geographical distribution of health professionals. However, we assessed the certainty of the evidence to be very low. Therefore, we are uncertain about the effects of National Health Insurance schemes on the distribution of health professionals. How up‐to‐date is this review?

Objectives To assess the effect of changes in the pre‐licensure education of health professionals on health‐worker supply. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) ( The Cochrane Library  2007, Issue 3), EMBASE, Ovid (1980 to week 3, October 2007), MEDLINE, Ovid (1950 to week 3, October 2007), CINAHL (October 2007), LILACS (week 4, November 2007), ERIC (1966 to week 3, February 2008), and Sociological Abstracts (October 2007). We searched WHO (WHOLIS) (February 2008), World Bank, Google Scholar, and human resources on health‐related websites to obtain grey literature. Key experts in human resources for health were contacted to identify unpublished studies. The reference lists of included studies were searched for additional articles. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials, non‐randomised controlled trials, controlled before and after studies, and interrupted time‐series studies that measured increased numbers of health workers ultimately available for recruitment into the health workforce or improved patient to health professional ratios as their primary outcomes were considered. Although the focus of the review was on LMIC, we included studies regardless of where they were done. Data collection and analysis Heterogeneity between the two included studies precluded meta‐analysis; therefore, data were presented separately for each study. Main results Two studies of the 7880 identified from searching the electronic databases met the inclusion criteria. Both studies were controlled before and after studies, of moderate to high risk of bias, that explored the effects of interventions to improve retention of minority groups in health professional training institutions. These studies reported that an intervention comprising of a package of student support activities including social, academic, and career guidance and mentorship resulted in an increase in the number of minority students who enrolled and graduated from health training institutions. Authors' conclusions The evidence to estimate the likely effects of interventions in pre‐licensure education to increase health‐worker supply is generally insufficient or unavailable, particularly in LMICs. Promising innovations from a high‐income country include providing financial support to health professional students or introducing mechanisms to identify and encourage potential students and offering support to 'at risk' students. These and other promising interventions should be evaluated in LMIC. Plain language summary Academic support, career guidance, and social support might increase student enrollment and reduce drop‐out rates among 'at‐risk' health professional students A comprehensive package comprising career guidance, mentoring, and academic, social and financial support may result in increased graduation rates among health professional students at risk of dropping out of study. Further research could focus on determining the magnitude of student drop‐out rates in health professional training institutions, identifying the students at risk of dropping out, and determining the applicability of western‐based innovations in low and middle‐income countries. Evaluation of ongoing and planned interventions in pre‐licensure education of health professionals is important.","2","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Career Choice; *Health Workforce; *Minority Groups; Health Personnel [*education]; Humans; Vocational Guidance [*methods]","10.1002/14651858.CD007018.pub2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD007018.pub2","Effective Practice and Organisation of Care"

Depending on the proportion of the population served by public or private organizations in a particular setting, this movement may result in imbalances in the number of healthcare providers available relative to the population receiving care from that sector. However, both public and private organizations are needed as each sector has unique contributions to make to the effective delivery of health services. Objectives To assess the effects of financial incentives and movement restriction interventions to manage the movement of health workers between public and private organizations in low‐ and middle‐income countries. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (10 November 2012); EMBASE (7 June 2011); LILACS (9 June 2011); MEDLINE (10 November 2012); CINAHL (13 August 2012); and the British Nursing Index (13 August 2012). Selection criteria Randomized controlled trials and non‐randomized controlled trials; controlled before‐and‐after studies if pre‐ and post‐intervention periods for study and control groups were the same and there were at least two units included in both the intervention and control groups; uncontrolled and controlled interrupted time series studies if the point in time when the intervention occurred was clearly defined and there were at least three or more data points before and after the intervention. Interventions included payment of special allowances, increasing salaries, bonding health workers, offering bursary schemes, scholarships or lucrative terminal benefits, and hiring people on contract basis. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently applied the criteria for inclusion and exclusion of studies to the titles and abstracts of all articles obtained from the search. The same two review authors independently screened the full reports of the selected citations. At each stage, we compared the results and resolved discrepancies through discussion with a third review author. Main results We found no studies that were eligible for inclusion in this review. Authors' conclusions We identified no rigorous studies on the effects of interventions to manage the movement of health workers between public and private organizations in low‐ and middle‐income countries. Health worker availability is a key obstacle in delivery of health services. Interventions to make the health sector more responsive to the expectations of populations by having more health workers in the sector that serves most people would contribute to the more efficient use of the health workforce. More research is needed to assess the effect of increase in salaries, offering scholarships or bonding on movement of health workers in one sector compared with another. Plain language summary The effect of interventions to manage the movement of health workers between the public and the private health sector Researchers in the Cochrane Collaboration conducted a review to evaluate the effect of approaches to encourage health workers to work in particular healthcare facilities. After searching for all relevant studies, they were unable to find any studies that met their requirements for inclusion in this review. Background Many countries have a severe lack of health workers. In addition, the health workers that are available are often not distributed in the best possible way. Most health workers work in urban areas, leaving rural areas underserved. Problems also occur in urban areas as health workers here often prefer to work in the private healthcare sector, which is often too expensive for many people. In rural areas, governments may not have built health facilities and the only available health care in these areas may, therefore, be private. However, private facilities in rural areas are not only expensive but may also struggle to attract qualified health workers. To address these problems, governments need to find ways of ensuring that more health workers work in the areas and facilities where most people seek care. This might, for instance, involve encouraging health workers to work in public healthcare facilities in towns and cities or to work in public or private facilities in rural areas. One approach governments could take is to give extra incentives to health workers serving in particular facilities. These incentives could include higher salaries, special allowances, or higher retirement packages. Another approach is to give health workers bursaries or scholarships during training on the condition that they work in particular facilities for a fixed period of time after they have finished their training. Results Although these types of approaches are not uncommon, the review could not find any relevant studies that gave a reliable assessment of their impact. There is still a lot of work to be done to understand how governments can ensure that health workers serve in those health facilities that care for the majority of the population.","2","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Developing Countries; *Employee Incentive Plans; *Private Sector; *Public Sector; Health Workforce [*economics]; Humans; Personnel Turnover [*economics]","10.1002/14651858.CD009845.pub2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD009845.pub2","Effective Practice and Organisation of Care"

People with ASD often also have language difficulties, and about 25% to 30% of children with ASD either fail to develop functional language or are minimally verbal. The ability to communicate effectively is an essential life skill, and difficulties with communication can have a range of adverse outcomes, including poorer academic achievement, behavioural difficulties and reduced quality of life. Historically, most studies have investigated communication interventions for ASD in verbal children. We cannot assume the same interventions will work for minimally verbal children with ASD. Objectives To assess the effects of communication interventions for ASD in minimally verbal children. Search methods We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE and Embase as well as 12 other databases and three trials registers in November 2017. We also checked the reference lists of all included studies and relevant reviews, contacting experts in the field as well as authors of identified studies about other potentially relevant ongoing and unpublished studies. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of communication‐focused interventions for children (under 12 years of age) diagnosed with ASD and who are minimally verbal (fewer than 30 functional words or unable to use speech alone to communicate), compared with no treatment, wait‐list control or treatment as usual. Data collection and analysis We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. Main results This review includes two RCTs (154 children aged 32 months to 11 years) of communication interventions for ASD in minimally verbal children compared with a control group (treatment as usual). One RCT used a verbally based intervention (focused playtime intervention; FPI) administered by parents in the home, whereas the other used an alternative and augmentative communication (AAC) intervention (Picture Exchange Communication System; PECS) administered by teachers in a school setting. The FPI study took place in the USA and included 70 participants (64 boys) aged 32 to 82 months who were minimally verbal and had received a diagnosis of ASD. This intervention focused on developing coordinated toy play between child and parent. Participants received 12 in‐home parent training sessions for 90 minutes per session for 12 weeks, and they were also invited to attend parent advocacy coaching sessions. This study was funded by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, the MIND Institute Research Program and a Professional Staff Congress‐City University of New York grant. The PECS study included 84 minimally verbal participants (73 boys) aged 4 to 11 years who had a formal diagnosis of ASD and who were not using PECS beyond phase 1 at baseline. All children attended autism‐specific classes or units, and most classes had a child to adult ratio of 2:1. Teachers and parents received PECS training (two‐day workshop). PECS consultants also conducted six half‐day consultations with each class once per month over five months. This study took place in the UK and was funded by the Three Guineas Trust. Both included studies had high or unclear risk of bias in at least four of the seven 'Risk of bias' categories, with a lack of blinding for participants and personnel being the most problematic area. Using the GRADE approach, we rated the overall quality of the evidence as very low due to risk of bias, imprecision (small sample sizes and wide confidence intervals) and because there was only one trial identified per type of intervention (i.e. verbally based or AAC). Both studies focused primarily on communication outcomes (verbal and non‐verbal). One of the studies also collected information on social communication. The FPI study found no significant improvement in spoken communication, measured using the expressive language domain of the Mullen Scale of Early Learning expressive language, at postintervention. However, this study found that children with lower expressive language at baseline (less than 11.3 months age‐equivalent) improved more than children with better expressive language and that the intervention produced expressive language gains in some children. The PECS study found that children enrolled in the AAC intervention were significantly more likely to use verbal initiations and PECS symbols immediately postintervention; however, gains were not maintained 10 months later. There was no evidence that AAC improved frequency of speech, verbal expressive vocabulary or children's social communication or pragmatic language immediately postintervention. Overall, neither of the interventions (PECS or FPI) resulted in maintained improvements in spoken or non‐verbal communication in most children. Neither study collected information on adverse events, other communication skills, quality of life or behavioural outcomes. Authors' conclusions There is limited evidence that verbally based and ACC interventions improve spoken and non‐verbal communication in minimally verbal children with ASD. A substantial number of studies have investigated communication interventions for minimally verbal children with ASD, yet only two studies met inclusion criteria for this review, and we considered the overall quality of the evidence to be very low. In the study that used an AAC intervention, there were significant gains in frequency of PECS use and verbal and non‐verbal initiations, but not in expressive vocabulary or social communication immediately postintervention. In the study that investigated a verbally based intervention, there were no significant gains in expressive language postintervention, but children with lower expressive language at the beginning of the study improved more than those with better expressive language at baseline. Neither study investigated adverse events, other communication skills, quality of life or behavioural outcomes. Future RCTs that compare two interventions and include a control group will allow us to better understand treatment effects in the context of spontaneous maturation and will allow further comparison of different interventions as well as the investigation of moderating factors. Plain language summary Are communication interventions effective for minimally verbal children with autism spectrum disorder? Background Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a condition that is characterised by difficulties with the social aspects of communication, and repetitive and restricted interests and behaviours (e.g. repetitive body movements such as hand flapping, sensory sensitivities and circumscribed interests). People with ASD commonly also have language difficulties, and around 25% to 30% of children are unable to use verbal language to communicate or are minimally verbal (use fewer than 30 words). The ability to communicate is a crucial life skill, and difficulties with communication can have a range of negative consequences such as poorer academic performance, poorer quality of life and behavioural difficulties. Communication interventions generally aim to improve children's ability to communicate either through speech or by supplementing speech with other means (e.g. sign language or pictures). What did we look at? We searched 18 databases and trials registers in November 2016 and updated the search in November 2017. What did our study find? We identified two trials involving 154 minimally verbal children who had ASD (aged 32 months to 11 years). The studies randomly divided participants into those that received a communication intervention and a control group that did not receive the intervention but received treatment as usual in the community. Both studies focused primarily on communication outcomes (verbal and non‐verbal). One of the studies also collected information on social communication. Neither study collected information on adverse events, other communication skills, quality of life or behavioural outcomes. One study looked at an alternative and augmentative communication (ACC) intervention (Picture Exchange Communication System; PECS), which teachers gave the children in school. This intervention was conducted over five months and involved teacher training and consultation. PECS is a staged approach where children are taught to exchange a single picture of a desired item or action to another person who then responds to the request. The system progresses toward putting pictures together in sentences and using these sentences in a variety of ways such as commenting and answering questions. This study included 84 participants (73 boys) aged 4 to 11 years and was funded by the Three Guineas Trust. The other study looked at a verbally based intervention (focused playtime intervention; FPI), which is a home‐based parent education programme that aims to promote coordinated play with toys between parents and their children. This study included 70 participants (64 boys) aged 32 months to 82 months and was funded by a Clinical and Patient Educators Association grant (HD35470) from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, the MIND Institute Research Program, and a Professional Staff Congress‐City University of New York grant. Main results There is limited evidence that verbally based and AAC interventions improve spoken and non‐verbal communication in minimally verbal children with ASD. Both studies included in this review reported gains in aspects of verbal or non‐verbal communication (or both) for some children immediately after the intervention. Neither of the interventions resulted in improvements in verbal or non‐verbal communication that were maintained over time for most children. We rated the overall quality of the evidence as very low because we only found two eligible studies, and they involved few participants. Furthermore, both studies had some methodological limitations that increased their risk of bias. Recommendations There is currently limited evidence that verbally based and ACC interventions improve expressive communication skills in minimally verbal children with ASD aged 32 months to 11 years. Additional trials that use communication interventions and compare the effects of these interventions to a control group are urgently required to build the evidence base.","11","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Nonverbal Communication; Autism Spectrum Disorder [*complications]; Child; Child, Preschool; Female; Humans; Language Development Disorders [complications, *therapy]; Language Tests; Language Therapy [*methods]; Male; Parents [education]; Play Therapy [*methods]; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; School Teachers; Teacher Training; Treatment Outcome","10.1002/14651858.CD012324.pub2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD012324.pub2","Developmental, Psychosocial and Learning Problems"

In the European Union the prevalence of work‐related stress was estimated at about 22%. There is consensus that stress, absenteeism, and well‐being of employees can be influenced by leadership behaviour. Existing reviews predominantly included cross‐sectional and non‐experimental studies, which have limited informative value in deducing causal relationships between leadership interventions and health outcomes. Objectives To assess the effect of four types of human resource management (HRM) training for supervisors on employees' psychomental stress, absenteeism, and well‐being. We included training aimed at improving supervisor‐employee interaction, either off‐the‐job or on‐the‐job training, and training aimed at improving supervisors' capability of designing the work environment, either off‐the‐job or on‐the‐job training. Search methods In May 2019 we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, four other databases, and most relevant trials registers (ICTRP, TroPHI, ClinicalTrials.gov). We did not impose any language restrictions on the searches. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCT), cluster‐randomised controlled trials (cRCT), and controlled before‐after studies (CBA) with at least two intervention and control sites, which examined the effects of supervisor training on psychomental stress, absenteeism, and well‐being of employees within natural settings of organisations by means of validated measures. Data collection and analysis At least two authors independently screened abstracts and full texts, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of included studies. We analysed study data from intervention and control groups with respect to different comparisons, outcomes, follow‐up time, study designs, and intervention types. We pooled study results by use of standardised mean differences (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals when possible. We assessed the quality of evidence for each outcome using the GRADE approach. Main results We included 25 studies of which 4 are awaiting assessment. The 21 studies that could be analysed were 1 RCT, 14 cRCTs and 6 CBAs with a total of at least 3479 employees in intervention and control groups. We judged 12 studies to have an unclear risk of bias and the remaining nine studies to have a high risk of bias. Sixteen studies focused on improving supervisor‐employee interaction, whereas five studies aimed at improving the design of working environments by means of supervisor training. Training versus no intervention We found very low‐quality evidence that supervisor training does not reduce employees' stress levels (6 studies) or absenteeism (1 study) when compared to no intervention, regardless of intervention type or follow‐up. We found inconsistent, very low‐quality evidence that supervisor training aimed at employee interaction may (2 studies) or may not (7 studies) improve employees' well‐being when compared to no intervention. Effects from two studies were not estimable due to missing data. Training versus placebo We found moderate‐quality evidence (2 studies) that supervisor training off the job aimed at employee interaction does not reduce employees' stress levels more than a placebo training at mid‐term follow‐up. We found low‐quality evidence in one study that supervisor training on the job aimed at employee interaction does not reduce employees' absenteeism more than placebo training at long‐term follow‐up. Effects from one study were not estimable due to insufficient data. Training versus other training One study compared the effects of supervisor training off the job aimed at employee interaction on employees' stress levels to training off the job aimed at working conditions at long‐term follow‐up but due to insufficient data, effects were not estimable. Authors' conclusions Based on a small and heterogeneous sample of controlled intervention studies and in contrast to prevailing consensus that supervisor behaviour influences employees' health and well‐being, we found inconsistent evidence that supervisor training may or may not improve employees' well‐being when compared to no intervention. For all other types of interventions and outcomes, there was no evidence of a considerable effect. However, due to the very low‐ to moderate‐quality of the evidence base, clear conclusions are currently unwarranted. Well‐designed studies are needed to clarify effects of supervisor training on employees' stress, absenteeism, and well‐being. Plain language summary Effects of training supervisors on employees' stress, absenteeism, and well‐being Background Supervisors are assumed to play a crucial role in creating the working conditions of their employees and thus promoting their health and well‐being. Training programmes are widely used to improve supervisors' skills in improving health and well‐being of their employees. Review question We examined the effects of four types of training for supervisors on employees' stress, absenteeism, and mental well‐being. We assessed the effects of training aiming to improve interaction between supervisors and employees, either off‐the‐job or on‐the‐job.We also assessed training aimed at improving supervisors' capabilities to design the work environment, either off‐the‐job or on‐the‐job. Study characteristics We included 25 studies of which 4 studies are awaiting assessment. The 21 studies that could be analysed included a total of 3479 employees. Sixteen studies trained supervisor‐employee interaction, either off‐the‐job (9 studies) or on‐the job (7 studies). Five studies trained the design of working environments, off‐the‐job in 2 studies and on‐the job in 3 studies. The 21 studies compared 23 interventions with no training, sham training or other training at various times of follow‐up. Key results There is no considerable effect of supervisor training on employees' stress (6 studies) or absenteeism (1 study) when compared to no training. There is inconsistent evidence that supervisor training may (2 studies) or may not (7 studies) improve employees' well‐being when compared to no training. Data were missing from two studies, so we could not calculate the effects of training on employee well‐being. There is no effect of supervisor training on employees' stress (2 studies) or absenteeism (1 study) when compared to a placebo training. Data were missing from one study, so we could not calculate the effects of training on employee well‐being. One study that evaluated supervisor training compared to another type of training to reduce employees' stress did not provide enough data to calculate its effects. Quality of the evidence The quality of the evidence was very low for most outcomes due to risk of bias in the studies, inconsistent results, and imprecise effects. Researchers should consider the shortcomings of studies included in this review in order to conduct well‐designed studies in the future and report them appropriately. Conclusions Overall, the data suggest that training of supervisors may not lead to reduced levels of stress and absenteeism, or improved levels of well‐being in their employees. The discrepancy between the apparent scientific consensus and the empirical evidence might be attributed to weak study designs.High quality studies are needed to clarify if supervisor training affects employees' stress, absenteeism, and well‐being.","9","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Burnout, Professional; *Leadership; *Occupational Health; *Personnel Management; *Stress, Psychological; Absenteeism; Health Promotion [methods]; Humans; Mental Disorders; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Workforce; Workplace","10.1002/14651858.CD010905.pub2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD010905.pub2","Work"

These include changes in skill mix, grade mix or qualification mix, staff‐allocation models, staffing levels, nursing shifts, or nurses’ work patterns. This is the first update of our review published in 2011. Objectives The purpose of this review was to explore the effect of hospital nurse‐staffing models on patient and staff‐related outcomes in the hospital setting, specifically to identify which staffing model(s) are associated with: 1) better outcomes for patients, 2) better staff‐related outcomes, and, 3) the impact of staffing model(s) on cost outcomes. Search methods CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, two other databases and two trials registers were searched on 22 March 2018 together with reference checking, citation searching and contact with study authors to identify additional studies. Selection criteria We included randomised trials, non‐randomised trials, controlled before‐after studies and interrupted‐time‐series or repeated‐measures studies of interventions relating to hospital nurse‐staffing models. Participants were patients and nursing staff working in hospital settings. We included any objective reported measure of patient‐, staff‐related, or economic outcome. The most important outcomes included in this review were: nursing‐staff turnover, patient mortality, patient readmissions, patient attendances at the emergency department (ED), length of stay, patients with pressure ulcers, and costs. Data collection and analysis We worked independently in pairs to extract data from each potentially relevant study and to assess risk of bias and the certainty of the evidence. Main results We included 19 studies, 17 of which were included in the analysis and eight of which we identified for this update. We identified four types of interventions relating to hospital nurse‐staffing models: ‐ introduction of advanced or specialist nurses to the nursing workforce; ‐ introduction of nursing assistive personnel to the hospital workforce; ‐ primary nursing; and ‐ staffing models. The studies were conducted in the USA, the Netherlands, UK, Australia, and Canada and included patients with cancer, asthma, diabetes and chronic illness, on medical, acute care, intensive care and long‐stay psychiatric units. The risk of bias across studies was high, with limitations mainly related to blinding of patients and personnel, allocation concealment, sequence generation, and blinding of outcome assessment. The addition of advanced or specialist nurses to hospital nurse staffing may lead to little or no difference in patient mortality (3 studies, 1358 participants). It is uncertain whether this intervention reduces patient readmissions (7 studies, 2995 participants), patient attendances at the ED (6 studies, 2274 participants), length of stay (3 studies, 907 participants), number of patients with pressure ulcers (1 study, 753 participants), or costs (3 studies, 617 participants), as we assessed the evidence for these outcomes as being of very low certainty. It is uncertain whether adding nursing assistive personnel to the hospital workforce reduces costs (1 study, 6769 participants), as we assessed the evidence for this outcome to be of very low certainty. It is uncertain whether primary nursing (3 studies, > 464 participants) or staffing models (1 study, 647 participants) reduces nursing‐staff turnover, or if primary nursing (2 studies, > 138 participants) reduces costs, as we assessed the evidence for these outcomes to be of very low certainty. Authors' conclusions The findings of this review should be treated with caution due to the limited amount and quality of the published research that was included. We have most confidence in our finding that the introduction of advanced or specialist nurses may lead to little or no difference in one patient outcome (i.e. mortality) with greater uncertainty about other patient outcomes (i.e. readmissions, ED attendance, length of stay and pressure ulcer rates). The evidence is of insufficient certainty to draw conclusions about the effectiveness of other types of interventions, including new nurse‐staffing models and introduction of nursing assistive personnel, on patient, staff and cost outcomes. Although it has been seven years since the original review was published, the certainty of the evidence about hospital nurse staffing still remains very low. Plain language summary What do we know about the impact of hospital nurse staffing on patients, staff and the costs of care? What is the aim of this review? The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out if changes made to nurse staffing in hospitals improve outcomes for patients or nurses, or have an impact on the cost of health care. Nurse staffing can refer to the number of nurses per patient, the mix of different types of nurses in a hospital unit, or models used to allocate nurses to patients in a hospital unit. Key messages The research relating to hospital nurse staffing is very limited and the findings should be treated with caution. It is unlikely that adding nurses with advanced nursing skills (Nurse Practitioners (NPs)) or with expertise in a particular area of practice (Clinical Nurse Specialists (CNSs)) to hospital nurse staffing makes any difference to patient death rates. We cannot be sure what other effect it might have on patients, for example, if it reduces the time patients spend in hospital or the costs of patient care. We cannot be sure if changes to the way in which nurses are allocated to patient care reduces the numbers of nurses resigning, or if introducing unqualified nurses to the nursing workforce reduces costs, as the research here is very limited too. What was studied in the review? We found studies that looked at the effects of four main strategies or models of nurse staffing: adding advanced or specialist nurses to the nursing workforce, introducing less‐qualified nursing personnel to the nursing workforce, changing the way in which nurses are allocated within a hospital unit to provide patient care, and changing the way hospital units schedule nursing shifts. We were most interested in the impact of these interventions on seven main outcomes: nursing‐staff resignations (turnover), patient deaths, patients being readmitted following discharge from the hospital, patients attending the Emergency Department (ED) for care following discharge, the number of days patients stayed in the hospital, the number of patients with pressure sores, and the costs of care. What are the main results of the review? We found 11 studies where advanced or specialist nurses were added to the nursing workforce. None of the studies reported the impact of this intervention on nursing‐staff resignations; three studies found that it may make little or no difference to patient deaths. We cannot be sure whether this intervention has an effect on reducing the number of patients being readmitted following discharge from hospital or attending an ED for care after discharge because the research is very limited. As well, we are uncertain about its effect on reducing the number of days patients stayed in the hospital, the number of patients with pressure sores, or healthcare costs, again because the research is very limited. We found one relevant study that looked at adding nursing assistants to the nursing workforce, which was aimed at reducing costs. We cannot be sure about the effect on costs as the research is very limited. We found five studies of primary nursing (where one nurse is responsible for the total care of a number of patients 24 hours a day, seven days a week) and two studies of nurse‐staffing models. One nurse‐staffing model study tested hospital units scheduling their own nursing shifts (self‐staffing), and the other study compared different ways to schedule nursing shifts. We cannot be sure about the impact of primary nursing or nurse‐staffing models on nurse resignations or costs because the research is very limited. How up‐to‐date is this review?

There are several interventions that may be effective in tackling the high prevalence of work‐related musculoskeletal disorders among workers, such as physical, cognitive and organisational interventions. In this review, we will focus on work breaks as a measure of primary prevention, which are a type of organisational intervention. Objectives To compare the effectiveness of different work‐break schedules for preventing work‐related musculoskeletal symptoms and disorders in healthy workers, when compared to conventional or alternate work‐break schedules. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, SCOPUS, Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, to April/May 2019. In addition, we searched references of the included studies and of relevant literature reviews. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of work‐break interventions for preventing work‐related musculoskeletal symptoms and disorders among workers. The studies were eligible for inclusion when intervening on work‐break frequency, duration and/or type, compared to conventional or an alternate work‐break intervention. We included only those studies in which the investigated population included healthy, adult workers, who were free of musculoskeletal complaints during study enrolment, without restrictions to sex or occupation. The primary outcomes were newly diagnosed musculoskeletal disorders, self‐reported musculoskeletal pain, discomfort or fatigue, and productivity or work performance. We considered workload changes as secondary outcomes. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently screened titles, abstracts and full texts for study eligibility, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We contacted authors for additional study data where required. We performed meta‐analyses, where possible, and we assessed the overall quality of the evidence for each outcome of each comparison using the five GRADE considerations. Main results We included six studies (373 workers), four parallel RCTs, one cross‐over RCT, and one combined parallel plus cross‐over RCT. At least 295 of the employees were female and at least 39 male; for the remaining 39 employees, the sex was not specified in the study trial. The studies investigated different work‐break frequencies (five studies) and different work‐break types (two studies). None of the studies investigated different work‐break durations. We judged all studies to have a high risk of bias. The quality of the evidence for the primary outcomes of self‐reported musculoskeletal pain, discomfort and fatigue was low; the quality of the evidence for the primary outcomes of productivity and work performance was very low. The studies were executed in Europe or Northern America, with none from low‐ to middle‐income countries. One study could not be included in the data analyses, because no detailed results have been reported. Changes in the frequency of work breaks There is low‐quality evidence that additional work breaks may not have a considerable effect on musculoskeletal pain, discomfort or fatigue, when compared with no additional work breaks (standardised mean difference (SMD) ‐0.08; 95% CI ‐0.35 to 0.18; three studies; 225 participants). Additional breaks may not have a positive effect on productivity or work performance, when compared with no additional work breaks (SMD ‐0.07; 95% CI ‐0.33 to 0.19; three studies; 225 participants; very low‐quality evidence). We found low‐quality evidence that additional work breaks may not have a considerable effect on participant‐reported musculoskeletal pain, discomfort or fatigue (MD 1.80 on a 100‐mm VAS scale; 95% CI ‐41.07 to 64.37; one study; 15 participants), when compared to work breaks as needed (i.e. microbreaks taken at own discretion). There is very low‐quality evidence that additional work breaks may have a positive effect on productivity or work performance, when compared to work breaks as needed (MD 542.5 number of words typed per 3‐hour recording session; 95% CI 177.22 to 907.78; one study; 15 participants). Additional higher frequency work breaks may not have a considerable effect on participant‐reported musculoskeletal pain, discomfort or fatigue (MD 11.65 on a 100‐mm VAS scale; 95% CI ‐41.07 to 64.37; one study; 10 participants; low‐quality evidence), when compared to additional lower frequency work breaks. We found very low‐quality evidence that additional higher frequency work breaks may not have a considerable effect on productivity or work performance (MD ‐83.00 number of words typed per 3‐hour recording session; 95% CI ‐305.27 to 139.27; one study; 10 participants), when compared to additional lower frequency work breaks. Changes in the duration of work breaks No trials were identified that assessed the effect of different durations of work breaks. Changes in the type of work break We found low‐quality evidence that active breaks may not have a considerable positive effect on participant‐reported musculoskeletal pain, discomfort and fatigue (MD ‐0.17 on a 1‐7 NRS scale; 95% CI ‐0.71 to 0.37; one study; 153 participants), when compared to passive work breaks. Relaxation work breaks may not have a considerable effect on participant‐reported musculoskeletal pain, discomfort or fatigue, when compared to physical work breaks (MD 0.20 on a 1‐7 NRS scale; 95% CI ‐0.43 to 0.82; one study; 97 participants; low‐quality evidence). Authors' conclusions We found low‐quality evidence that different work‐break frequencies may have no effect on participant‐reported musculoskeletal pain, discomfort and fatigue. For productivity and work performance, evidence was of very low‐quality that different work‐break frequencies may have a positive effect. For different types of break, there may be no effect on participant‐reported musculoskeletal pain, discomfort and fatigue according to low‐quality evidence. Further high‐quality studies are needed to determine the effectiveness of frequency, duration and type of work‐break interventions among workers, if possible, with much higher sample sizes than the studies included in the current review. Furthermore, work‐break interventions should be reconsidered, taking into account worker populations other than office workers, and taking into account the possibility of combining work‐break intervention with other interventions such as ergonomic training or counselling, which may may possibly have an effect on musculoskeletal outcomes and work performance. Plain language summary Work‐break schedules for preventing musculoskeletal symptoms and disorders in healthy workers The number of workers suffering from work‐related musculoskeletal disorders is estimated to account for 21% to 28% of all days of occupational sick leave in 2017/2018 in the UK, Germany and the Netherlands. These numbers indicate that work‐related musculoskeletal disorders are a major problem for society as well as for employers. Interventions may counteract this problem, for example, by making changes to the workplace or work organisation. Many interventions have been investigated, such as training in ergonomics principles ( work designs to increase productivity and comfort at the workplace ), information and counselling, workstation adjustment, work‐break schedule adjustment, and job rotation. The current review focused on the effect of different work‐break schedules on outcomes related to work‐related musculoskeletal symptoms, since a systematic overview on this particular intervention is currently lacking. Different work‐break schedules may lead to an interruption or a decrease of long periods of repetitive or monotonous workloads. They may also lead to interruption of longer periods in which workers have to adopt static or awkward body postures, factors recognised as risk factors for developing work‐related musculoskeletal disorders. Aim We wanted to find out whether different frequencies, durations and types of work breaks can prevent work‐related musculoskeletal symptoms and disorders among healthy workers. We considered workers as healthy when they were free of musculoskeletal complaints at study enrolment. Studies We selected several primary outcome measures, including newly diagnosed musculoskeletal disorders, participant‐reported musculoskeletal symptoms including pain, discomfort and fatigue, and productivity and work performance. The latter measure is not directly relevant to the worker but rather to the employer when it comes to maintaining business output. We selected changes in workload as a secondary outcome measure, which may include force output changes, electromyographic ( recording of the electrical activity of muscles using electrodes ) manifestations of muscle fatigue, or subjective change in workload (NASA‐TLX). None of the included studies reported any newly diagnosed musculoskeletal disorders or workload changes. We searched the literature until 2 May 2019 to find randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi‐RCTs, cluster‐RCTs and cross‐over RCTs of work‐break interventions aimed at preventing work‐related musculoskeletal disorders at work. We analysed all relevant studies to answer the research question and found six studies involving 373 workers, the majority of whom were female (≥ 78%), with a follow‐up period of two to 10 weeks. Key results Effect of different work‐break frequencies Five of the six studies evaluated different work‐break frequencies. The implementation of additional work breaks (three studies) may not have an effect on musculoskeletal pain, discomfort or fatigue when compared to no additional work breaks or work breaks taken as needed. Additional work breaks (three studies) may have a positive effect on productivity and work performance when compared to a conventional work‐break schedule. Additional higher frequency work breaks have been compared with additional lower frequency work breaks in one study, which resulted in no differences in participant‐reported musculoskeletal pain, discomfort and fatigue, nor in productivity and work performance. Effect of different work‐break durations None of the studies evaluated the effect of duration of work breaks. Effect of different work‐break types Two of the six studies evaluated different work‐break types. Active work breaks (one study) may not reduce nor increase the incidence of participant‐reported musculoskeletal pain, discomfort and fatigue, or productivity and work performance. Similarly, different active work breaks have been compared with one another (one study), i.e. relaxation and physical active work breaks, which revealed no differences in participant‐reported musculoskeletal pain, discomfort and fatigue, nor in productivity and work performance. Conclusions At present, we conclude that there is very low‐ to low‐quality evidence that different work‐break frequencies and types may not considerably reduce the incidence of musculoskeletal disorders. Although the results suggest that there may be a positive effect of different work‐break frequencies on productivity and work performance, there is a need for high‐quality studies with large enough sample sizes to assess the effectiveness of different work‐break interventions. Furthermore, work‐break interventions should be reconsidered, taking into account worker populations other than office workers and the possibility of combining work‐break interventions with other interventions such as ergonomic training or counselling, which may possibly prevent musculoskeletal disorders.","7","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Health Personnel; *Personnel Staffing and Scheduling; Adult; Ergonomics; Health Workforce; Humans; Musculoskeletal Diseases [*prevention & control]; Occupational Diseases [*prevention & control]; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Workplace","10.1002/14651858.CD012886.pub2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD012886.pub2","Work"

Ethical case interventions (e.g. ethics committee, moral case deliberation) identify and analyse ethical conflicts which occur within the context of care for patients. Ethical case interventions involve ethical experts, different health professionals as well as the patient and his/her family. The aim is to support decision‐making in clinical practice. This systematic review gathered and critically appraised the available evidence of controlled studies on the effectiveness of ethical case interventions. Objectives To determine whether ethical case interventions result in reduced decisional conflict or moral distress of those affected by an ethical conflict in clinical practice; improved patient involvement in decision‐making and a higher quality of life in adult patients. To determine the most effective models of ethical case interventions and to analyse the use and appropriateness of the outcomes in experimental studies. Search methods We searched the following electronic databases for primary studies to September 2018: CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and PsycINFO. We also searched CDSR and DARE for related reviews. Furthermore, we searched Clinicaltrials.gov, International Clinical Trials Registry Platform Search Portal and conducted a cited reference search for all included studies in ISI WEB of Science. We also searched the references of the included studies. Selection criteria We included randomised trials, non‐randomised trials, controlled before‐after studies and interrupted time series studies which compared ethical case interventions with usual care or an active control in any language. The included population were adult patients. However, studies with mixed populations consisting of adults and children were included, if a subgroup or sensitivity analysis (or both) was performed for the adult population. Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane and the Effective Practice and Organisation of Care review group. We used meta‐analysis based on a random‐effects model for treatment costs and structured analysis for the remaining outcomes, because these were heterogeneously reported. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of the evidence. Main results We included four randomised trials published in six articles. The publication dates ranged from 2000 to 2014. Three studies were conducted in the USA, and one study in Taiwan. All studies were conducted on intensive care units and included 1165 patients. We judged the included studies to be of moderate or high risk of bias. It was not possible to compare different models of the intervention regarding effectiveness due to the diverse character of the interventions and the small number of studies. Included studies did not directly measure the main outcomes. All studies received public funding and one received additional funding from private sources. We identified two models of ethical case interventions: proactive and request‐based ethics consultation. Three studies evaluated proactive ethics consultation (n = 1103) of which one study reported findings on one key outcome criterion. The studies did not report data on decisional conflict, moral distress of participants of ethical case interventions, patient involvement in decision‐making, quality of life or ethical competency for proactive ethics consultation. One study assessed satisfaction with care on a 5‐point Likert scale (1 = lowest rating, 5 = highest rating). The healthcare providers (nurses and physicians, n = 365) scored a value of 4 or 5 for 81.4% in the control group and 86.1% in the intervention group (P > 0.05). The patients or their surrogates (n = 275) scored a value of 4 or 5 for 83.6% in the control group and for 74.8% in the intervention group (P > 0.05). It was uncertain whether proactive ethics consultation led to high satisfaction with care, because the certainty of evidence was very low. One study evaluated request‐based ethics consultation (n = 62). The study indirectly measured decisional conflict by assessing consensus regarding patient care. The risk (increase in consensus, reduction in decisional conflict) increased by 80% as a result of the intervention. The risk ratio was 0.20 (95% confidence interval 0.09 to 0.46; P < 0.01). It was uncertain whether request‐based ethics consultation reduced decisional conflict, because the certainty of evidence was very low. The study did not report data on moral distress of participants of ethical case interventions, patient involvement in decision‐making, quality of life, or ethical competency or satisfaction with care for request‐based ethics consultation. Authors' conclusions It is not possible to determine the effectiveness of ethical case interventions with certainty due to the low certainty of the evidence of included studies in this review. The effectiveness of ethical case interventions should be investigated in light of the outcomes reported in this systematic review. In addition, there is need for further research to identify and measure outcomes which reflect the goals of different types of ethical case intervention. Plain language summary Can ethical case interventions improve healthcare? What was the aim of this review? The aim of this review was to find out whether ethical case interventions could improve care for patients. Ethical case interventions (e.g. ethics committee, moral case deliberation) identify and analyse ethical conflicts which occur within the context of care for patients. A typical example for situations in which ethical conflicts can arise are cases in which it is uncertain whether provision or limitation of treatment is in line with patients' will or patient welfare (or both). Ethical case interventions involve ethical experts discussing ethical challenges of patient care (specific patient situations) with different health professionals responsible for the care of the patient as well as the patient and his family. The aim of ethical case interventions is to support decision‐making in clinical practice. Researchers in Cochrane collected and analysed all relevant studies to determine whether ethical case interventions improve patient care and found four relevant studies published in six articles. Key messages It was uncertain whether ethical case intervention reduced the decisional conflict of those who need to make decisions about treatment, because the certainty of evidence was very low. We found no studies reporting effects of ethical case interventions on moral distress, patient involvement in decision‐making, patients' quality of life or ethical competency. It was uncertain whether ethical case intervention increased satisfaction with care, because the certainty of evidence was very low. We need more high‐quality studies to evaluate ethical case intervention. What was studied in this review ? We chose the decisional conflict of participants affected by the decision, reduction of moral distress, patient involvement in decision‐making and quality of life of patients as main outcome criteria to assess whether ethical case interventions improve health care. What were the main results of this review? The review authors found four relevant studies with results published in six articles. All studies compared ethical case interventions with usual care in intensive care units. The studies used two different models of ethical case interventions – proactive and request‐based ethics consultation. In proactive ethics consultation, the ethicist himself/herself identifies potential ethical conflicts without being requested or ethics consultation is offered in response to latent conflicts. In request‐based ethics consultation, professionals, patients or their families specifically ask for an ethics consultation to resolve a specific ethical conflict. All studies received public funding and one received additional funding from private sources. Three studies reported on proactive ethics consultation. We found no data on decisional conflict, moral distress, patient involvement in decision‐making, quality of life of patients or ethical competency. One study assessed satisfaction with care. It was uncertain whether proactive ethics consultation increased satisfaction with care, because the certainty of the evidence was very low. One study reported on request‐based ethics consultation. The study assessed the level of consensus regarding decisions about the care of patients as an indirect criterion for the reduction of decisional conflict. It was uncertain whether request‐based ethics consultation increased consensus and, thus, reduced decisional conflict, because the certainty of the evidence was very low. We found no data on moral distress, patient involvement in decision‐making, quality of life of patients or ethical competency. How up to date is this review?

Determining and maintaining an appropriate level and mix of staff is especially problematic for those working in the long‐term aged‐care sector, where resident needs are complex and recruitment and retention of staff is challenging. Objectives To identify which staffing models are associated with the best patient and staff outcomes. Search methods We searched the Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC) Group Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness (DARE) in  The Cochrane Library  and the databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, Ageline, CINAHL, and Dissertation abstracts. We also handsearched the reference lists and bibliographies of all retrieved articles. Selection criteria This review considered interrupted time series studies and studies with concurrent control designs of care staff or residents of residential or subacute or extended aged‐care settings that evaluated the effectiveness of staffing models and skill mixes on resident and care staff outcomes. Data collection and analysis Two review authors critically appraised all studies that were retrieved based on the screening of titles and abstracts according to the EPOC Group's data collection checklist. The same two review authors independently extracted and summarised details of eligible studies using the data abstraction form developed by EPOC. Main results We included two studies (one interrupted time series and one controlled before‐and‐after study); both evaluated a primary‐care model compared with a either a team‐nursing model or a usual‐care model. The primary‐care model was found to provide slightly better results than the comparator for some outcomes such as resident well‐being or behaviour. While nursing staff favoured the primary‐care model in one study, neither study found significant improvements in staff outcomes using the primary model compared with the comparator. One study evaluated the uptake of the primary‐care model within their facilities and found incorporation of this model into their practice was limited. Authors' conclusions Apart from two small studies evaluating primary care, no evidence in the form of concurrently controlled trials could be identified. While these two studies generally favour the use of primary care, the research designs of both ITS and CBA studies are considered prone to bias, specifically selection and blinding of participants and assessors. Therefore, these studies should be regarded with caution and there is little clear evidence for the effective use of any specific model of care in residential aged care to benefit either residents or care staff. Research in this area is clearly needed. Plain language summary Effectiveness of staffing models in residential/subacute/extended aged‐care settings No conclusive research exists to suggest that any nursing model or skill‐mix model would be effective at improving patient or staff well‐being in a residential aged‐care facility. The evidence presented for a primary‐care model is not sufficient to suggest its use in an aged‐care facility.","6","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Homes for the Aged; *Models, Nursing; *Nursing Homes; Attitude of Health Personnel; Humans; Long‐Term Care; Models, Organizational; Personnel Staffing and Scheduling [*organization & administration]; Workforce","10.1002/14651858.CD006563.pub2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD006563.pub2","Effective Practice and Organisation of Care"

A Cochrane systematic review of interventions by Bohren and colleagues, concluded that having a labour companion improves outcomes for women and babies. The presence of a labour companion is therefore regarded as an important aspect of improving quality of care during labour and childbirth; however implementation of the intervention is not universal. Implementation of labour companionship may be hampered by limited understanding of factors affecting successful implementation across contexts. Objectives The objectives of the review were to describe and explore the perceptions and experiences of women, partners, community members, healthcare providers and administrators, and other key stakeholders regarding labour companionship; to identify factors affecting successful implementation and sustainability of labour companionship; and to explore how the findings of this review can enhance understanding of the related Cochrane systematic review of interventions. Search methods We searched MEDLINE, CINAHL, and POPLINE K4Health databases for eligible studies from inception to 9 September 2018. There were no language, date or geographic restrictions. Selection criteria We included studies that used qualitative methods for data collection and analysis; focused on women’s, partners’, family members’, doulas', providers', or other relevant stakeholders' perceptions and experiences of labour companionship; and were from any type of health facility in any setting globally. Data collection and analysis We used a thematic analysis approach for data extraction and synthesis, and assessed the confidence in the findings using the GRADE‐CERQual approach. We used two approaches to integrate qualitative findings with the intervention review findings. We used a logic model to theorise links between elements of the intervention and health and well‐being outcomes. We also used a matrix model to compare features of labour companionship identified as important in the qualitative evidence synthesis with the interventions included in the intervention review. Main results We found 51 studies (52 papers), mostly from high‐income countries and mostly describing women's perspectives. We assessed our level of confidence in each finding using the GRADE‐CERQual approach. We had high or moderate confidence in many of our findings. Where we only had low or very low confidence in a finding, we have indicated this. Labour companions supported women in four different ways. Companions gave informational support by providing information about childbirth, bridging communication gaps between health workers and women, and facilitating non‐pharmacological pain relief. Companions were advocates, which means they spoke up in support of the woman. Companions provided practical support, including encouraging women to move around, providing massage, and holding her hand. Finally, companions gave emotional support, using praise and reassurance to help women feel in control and confident, and providing a continuous physical presence. Women who wanted a companion present during labour and childbirth needed this person to be compassionate and trustworthy. Companionship helped women to have a positive birth experience. Women without a companion could perceive this as a negative birth experience. Women had mixed perspectives about wanting to have a male partner present (low confidence). Generally, men who were labour companions felt that their presence made a positive impact on both themselves (low confidence) and on the relationship with their partner and baby (low confidence), although some felt anxious witnessing labour pain (low confidence). Some male partners felt that they were not well integrated into the care team or decision‐making. Doulas often met with women before birth to build rapport and manage expectations. Women could develop close bonds with their doulas (low confidence). Foreign‐born women in high‐income settings may appreciate support from community‐based doulas to receive culturally‐competent care (low confidence). Factors affecting implementation included health workers and women not recognising the benefits of companionship, lack of space and privacy, and fearing increased risk of infection (low confidence). Changing policies to allow companionship and addressing gaps between policy and practice were thought to be important (low confidence). Some providers were resistant to or not well trained on how to use companions, and this could lead to conflict. Lay companions were often not integrated into antenatal care, which may cause frustration (low confidence). We compared our findings from this synthesis to the companionship programmes/approaches assessed in Bohren’s review of effectiveness. We found that most of these programmes did not appear to address these key features of labour companionship. Authors' conclusions We have high or moderate confidence in the evidence contributing to several of these review findings. Further research, especially in low‐ and middle‐income settings and with different cadres of healthcare providers, could strengthen the evidence for low‐ or very low‐confidence findings. Ahead of implementation of labour companionship, researchers and programmers should consider factors that may affect implementation, including training content and timing for providers, women and companions; physical structure of the labour ward; specifying clear roles for companions and providers; integration of companions; and measuring the impact of companionship on women’s experiences of care. Implementation research or studies conducted on labour companionship should include a qualitative component to evaluate the process and context of implementation, in order to better interpret results and share findings across contexts. Plain language summary Perceptions and experiences of labour companionship What is the aim of this synthesis? The aim of this Cochrane qualitative evidence synthesis was to explore how women, families, and health workers experience women going through labour and childbirth with a support person ('labour companion'). A labour companion may be the woman’s partner, family member, trained supporter (doula), or nurse/midwife. We collected and analysed all relevant qualitative studies to answer this question. This qualitative evidence synthesis links to another Cochrane Review by Bohren and colleagues from 2017 that assesses the effect of continuous support for women during childbirth. Continuous support improves health and well‐being for women and babies but factors affecting successful implementation are not well understood. Key messages Labour companions provide women with information, practical, and emotional support, and can speak up in support of women. Companions can help women have a positive birth experience and need to be compassionate and trustworthy. However, not all women who want a labour companion have one, especially in lower‐resource settings. What was studied in this synthesis? We use the term 'labour companionship' to describe support provided to women during labour and childbirth. In high‐income countries, women are often accompanied by family members or a doula. But in health facilities in low‐ and middle‐income countries, women may not be allowed to have any support person, and may go through labour and childbirth alone. Bohren's review from 2017 shows that supporting women during childbirth has positive effects on women's experiences and on their health. We sought to understand how women, partners, and healthcare providers felt about labour companionship, and what factors might influence women's access to labour companionship. What are the main findings? We found 51 studies, mostly from high‐income countries and mostly describing women's perspectives. We assessed our level of confidence in each finding using the GRADE‐CERQual approach. We had high or moderate confidence in many of our findings. Where we only had low or very low confidence in a finding, we have indicated this. Labour companions supported women in four different ways.

A skilled birth attendant (SBA) is a health worker such as a midwife, doctor, or nurse who is trained to manage normal pregnancy and childbirth. (S)he is also trained to identify, manage, and refer any health problems that arise for mother and baby. The skills, attitudes and behaviour of SBAs, and the extent to which they work in an enabling working environment, impact on the quality of care provided. If any of these factors are missing, mothers and babies are likely to receive suboptimal care. Objectives To explore the views, experiences, and behaviours of skilled birth attendants and those who support them; to identify factors that influence the delivery of intrapartum and postnatal care in low‐ and middle‐income countries; and to explore the extent to which these factors were reflected in intervention studies. Search methods Our search strategies specified key and free text terms related to the perinatal period, and the health provider, and included methodological filters for qualitative evidence syntheses and for low‐ and middle‐income countries.

We included studies from all levels of health care in low‐ and middle‐income countries. Data collection and analysis One review author extracted data and assessed study quality, and another review author checked the data. We synthesised data using the best fit framework synthesis approach and assessed confidence in the evidence using the GRADE‐CERQual (Confidence in the Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative research) approach. We used a matrix approach to explore whether the factors identified by health workers in our synthesis as important for providing maternity care were reflected in the interventions evaluated in the studies in a related intervention review. Main results We included 31 studies that explored the views and experiences of different types of SBAs, including doctors, midwives, nurses, auxiliary nurses and their managers. The included studies took place in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. Our synthesis pointed to a number of factors affecting SBAs’ provision of quality care. The following factors were based on evidence assessed as of moderate to high confidence. Skilled birth attendants reported that they were not always given sufficient training during their education or after they had begun clinical work. Also, inadequate staffing of facilities could increase the workloads of skilled birth attendants, make it difficult to provide supervision and result in mothers being offered poorer care. In addition, SBAs did not always believe that their salaries and benefits reflected their tasks and responsibilities and the personal risks they undertook. Together with poor living and working conditions, these issues were seen to increase stress and to negatively affect family life. Some SBAs also felt that managers lacked capacity and skills, and felt unsupported when their workplace concerns were not addressed. Possible causes of staff shortages in facilities included problems with hiring and assigning health workers to facilities where they were needed; lack of funding; poor management and bureaucratic systems; and low salaries. Skilled birth attendants and their managers suggested factors that could help recruit, keep, and motivate health workers, and improve the quality of care; these included good‐quality housing, allowances for extra work, paid vacations, continuing education, appropriate assessments of their work, and rewards. Skilled birth attendants’ ability to provide quality care was also limited by a lack of equipment, supplies, and drugs; blood and the infrastructure to manage blood transfusions; electricity and water supplies; and adequate space and amenities on maternity wards. These factors were seen to reduce SBAs’ morale, increase their workload and infection risk, and make them less efficient in their work. A lack of transport sometimes made it difficult for SBAs to refer women on to higher levels of care. In addition, women’s negative perceptions of the health system could make them reluctant to accept referral. We identified some other factors that also may have affected the quality of care, which were based on findings assessed as of low or very low confidence. Poor teamwork and lack of trust and collaboration between health workers appeared to negatively influence care. In contrast, good collaboration and teamwork appeared to increase skilled birth attendants’ motivation, their decision‐making abilities, and the quality of care. Skilled birth attendants’ workloads and staff shortages influenced their interactions with mothers. In addition, poor communication undermined trust between skilled birth attendants and mothers. Authors' conclusions Many factors influence the care that SBAs are able to provide to mothers during childbirth. These include access to training and supervision; staff numbers and workloads; salaries and living conditions; and access to well‐equipped, well‐organised healthcare facilities with water, electricity, and transport. Other factors that may play a role include the existence of teamwork and of trust, collaboration, and communication between health workers and with mothers. Skilled birth attendants reported many problems tied to all of these factors. Plain language summary What factors influence the delivery of care by skilled birth attendants in low‐ and middle‐income countries? Review aim The aim of this Cochrane synthesis of qualitative evidence was to identify factors that influence the provision of care by skilled birth attendants. To answer this question, we searched for and analysed qualitative studies of skilled birth attendants’ views, experiences, and behaviour. This synthesis complements another Cochrane Review assessing the effect of strategies to promote women’s use of healthcare facilities when giving birth. Key messages Many factors influence the care that skilled birth attendants provide to mothers during childbirth. These include access to training and supervision; staff numbers and workloads; salaries and living conditions; and access to well‐equipped, well‐organised healthcare facilities with water, electricity, and transport. Other factors that may play a role include the existence of teamwork, trust, collaboration, and communication between health workers and with mothers. Skilled birth attendants reported many problems tied to these factors. What did we study in the synthesis? In low‐ and middle‐income countries, many mothers still die during childbirth. Women are encouraged to give birth in health facilities rather than at home so they can receive care from skilled birth attendants. A skilled birth attendant is a health worker such as a midwife, doctor, or nurse who is trained to manage a normal pregnancy and childbirth, and refer the mother and newborn when complications arise. By exploring skilled birth attendants’ views, experiences, and behaviour, this synthesis aimed to identify factors that can influence their ability to provide quality care. Main findings We included 31 studies conducted in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. Participants were skilled birth attendants including doctors, midwives, nurses, auxiliary nurses and their managers. Our synthesis pointed to several factors that affected skilled birth attendants’ provision of quality care. The following factors are based on evidence assessed as of moderate to high confidence. Skilled birth attendants reported that they sometimes had insufficient training during their education or after they had begun work. Where facilities lacked staff, skilled birth attendants’ workloads could increase, it could become difficult to provide supervision, and mothers could receive poorer care. In addition, skilled birth attendants did not always believe that their salaries and benefits reflected their tasks and responsibilities and the personal risks they undertook. Together with poor living and working conditions, these issues could lead to stress and affect skilled birth attendants' family life. Some skilled birth attendants felt that managers lacked capacity and skills, and they felt unsupported when their workplace concerns were not addressed. Possible causes of staff shortages included problems with hiring and assigning health workers to health facilities; lack of funding; poor management and bureaucratic systems; and low salaries. Skilled birth attendants and their managers suggested factors that could help recruit, keep, and motivate health workers, and improve the quality of their work; these included good‐quality housing, allowances for extra work, paid vacations, continued education, proper assessments of their work, and rewards. Skilled birth attendants’ ability to provide quality care was also limited by a lack of equipment, drugs, and supplies; blood and the infrastructure to manage blood transfusions; electricity and water supplies; and adequate space and amenities on maternity wards. These factors were seen to reduce skilled birth attendants’ morale, increase their workload and infection risk, and make them less efficient in their work. A lack of transport sometimes made it difficult for skilled birth attendants to refer women to higher levels of care. In addition, women’s negative perceptions of the health system could make them reluctant to accept referral. We identified some other factors that also may have affected the quality of care, which were based on findings assessed as of low or very low confidence. Poor teamwork and lack of trust and collaboration between health workers appeared to negatively influence care. In contrast, good collaboration and teamwork appeared to increase skilled birth attendants’ motivation, their decision‐making abilities, and the quality of care. Skilled birth attendants’ workloads and staff shortages influenced their interactions with mothers. In addition, poor communication undermined trust between skilled birth attendants and mothers.

"CD009627.PUB2","Van der Roest, HG; Wenborn, J; Pastink, C; Dröes, RM; Orrell, M","Assistive technology for memory support in dementia","Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","2017","Abstract - Background The sustained interest in electronic assistive technology in dementia care has been fuelled by the urgent need to develop useful approaches to help support people with dementia at home. Also the low costs and wide availability of electronic devices make it more feasible to use electronic devices for the benefit of disabled persons. Information Communication Technology (ICT) devices designed to support people with dementia are usually referred to as Assistive Technology (AT) or Electronic Assistive Technology (EAT). By using AT in this review we refer to electronic assistive devices. A range of AT devices has been developed to support people with dementia and their carers to manage their daily activities and to enhance safety, for example electronic pill boxes, picture phones, or mobile tracking devices. Many are commercially available. However, the usefulness and user‐friendliness of these devices are often poorly evaluated. Although reviews of (electronic) memory aids do exist, a systematic review of studies focusing on the efficacy of AT for memory support in people with dementia is lacking. Such a review would guide people with dementia and their informal and professional carers in selecting appropriate AT devices. Objectives Primary objective To assess the efficacy of AT for memory support in people with dementia in terms of daily performance of personal and instrumental activities of daily living (ADL), level of dependency, and admission to long‐term care. Secondary objective To assess the impact of AT on: users (autonomy, usefulness and user‐friendliness, adoption of AT); cognitive function and neuropsychiatric symptoms; need for informal and formal care; perceived quality of life; informal carer burden, self‐esteem and feelings of competence; formal carer work satisfaction, workload and feelings of competence; and adverse events. Search methods We searched ALOIS, the Specialised Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group (CDCIG), on 10 November 2016. ALOIS is maintained by the Information Specialists of the CDCIG and contains studies in the areas of dementia prevention, dementia treatment and cognitive enhancement in healthy people. We also searched the following list of databases, adapting the search strategy as necessary: Centre for Reviews and Dissemination (CRD) Databases, up to May 2016; The Collection of Computer Science Bibliographies; DBLP Computer Science Bibliography; HCI Bibliography: Human‐Computer Interaction Resources; and AgeInfo, all to June 2016; PiCarta; Inspec; Springer Link Lecture Notes; Social Care Online; and IEEE Computer Society Digital Library, all to October 2016; J‐STAGE: Japan Science and Technology Information Aggregator, Electronic; and Networked Computer Science Technical Reference Library (NCSTRL), both to November 2016; Computing Research Repository (CoRR) up to December 2016; and OT seeker; and ADEAR, both to February 2017. In addition, we searched Google Scholar and OpenSIGLE for grey literature. Selection criteria We intended to review randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and clustered randomised trials with blinded assessment of outcomes that evaluated an electronic assistive device used with the single aim of supporting memory function in people diagnosed with dementia. The control interventions could either be 'care (or treatment) as usual' or non‐technological psychosocial interventions (including interventions that use non‐electronic assistive devices) also specifically aimed at supporting memory. Outcome measures included activities of daily living, level of dependency, clinical and care‐related outcomes (for example admission to long‐term care), perceived quality of life and well‐being, and adverse events resulting from the use of AT; as well as the effects of AT on carers. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently screened all titles and abstracts identified by the search. Main results We identified no studies which met the inclusion criteria. Authors' conclusions This review highlights the current lack of high‐quality evidence to determine whether AT is effective in supporting people with dementia to manage their memory problems. Plain language summary Assistive technology for memory support in dementia Review question We wanted to find out from a review of the evidence whether Assistive Technology can help people with dementia overcome some of the effects of their memory problems. Background Dementia causes memory problems that make it increasingly difficult to carry out everyday activities, for example cooking, remembering appointments, taking medication. The memory problems experienced can have a large negative impact on people with dementia, and may cause confusion, anxiety, embarrassment, or depression. This decreasing ability to carry out daily activities can cause stress to family carers who worry about the person’s safety and well‐being. A range of electronic devices — most commonly referred to as Assistive Technology (AT – used throughout this review), and sometimes as Electronic Assistive Technology (EAT) — have been developed to support people with dementia. The devices can be divided into four categories offering support with general and personal information (e.g. digital social charts); practical support with problems caused by the symptoms of dementia, especially memory loss (e.g. electronic pill dispenser boxes, electronic diaries); support with social contact and company (e.g. picture phones, interactive ‘pet’ robots); and support with perceived risks to health and safety (e.g. tracking devices, fall sensors). In this review, we concentrated on devices intended to help people manage their memory problems. We wanted to find our whether AT is effective at helping people who have memory problems due to dementia carry out their daily activities, and whether it makes them less dependent on others, improves their quality of life or has an effect on admission to institutional care. We also wanted to find out if it has any impact on family and paid carers. Study characteristics We searched systematically for all research studies that had evaluated AT by allocating people with dementia at random to an AT device or to 'usual care' or a non‐technological solution to support memory and then comparing outcomes. Our search included all the evidence available up to 10 November 2016. Key results We found no studies that met our criteria. Quality of the evidence The review identified a lot of literature on the development of AT, including reports of researchers working with people with dementia and their carers to determine the type and design of AT which might be useful. There was also a lot of guidance written for health professionals and potential users of AT. We found some small studies that had tested the effectiveness of selected AT devices, but the methods used were not of a high enough quality to meet the review criteria. Therefore we cannot be sure at the moment whether or not AT can really help people with dementia manage their memory problems. We believe more research should be done in this area.","6","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Dementia; *Electronics, Medical; *Memory; *Self‐Help Devices; Activities of Daily Living; Humans","10.1002/14651858.CD009627.pub2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD009627.pub2","Dementia and Cognitive Improvement"
"CD008416.PUB2","Ciciriello, S; Johnston, RV; Osborne, RH; Wicks, I; deKroo, T; Clerehan, R; O'Neill, C; Buchbinder, R","Multimedia educational interventions for consumers about prescribed and over‐the‐counter medications","Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","2013","Abstract - Background Health consumers increasingly want access to accurate, evidence‐based information about their medications. Currently, education about medications (that is, information that is designed to achieve health or illness related learning) is provided predominantly via spoken communication between the health provider and consumer, sometimes supplemented with written materials. There is evidence, however, that current educational methods are not meeting consumer needs. Multimedia educational programs offer many potential advantages over traditional forms of education delivery. Objectives To assess the effects of multimedia patient education interventions about prescribed and over‐the‐counter medications in people of all ages, including children and carers. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL,  The Cochrane Library  2011, Issue 6), MEDLINE (1950 to June 2011), EMBASE (1974 to June 2011), CINAHL (1982 to June 2011), PsycINFO (1967 to June 2011), ERIC (1966 to June 2011), ProQuest Dissertation & Theses Database (to June 2011) and reference lists of articles. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs of multimedia‐based patient education about prescribed or over‐the‐counter medications in people of all ages, including children and carers, if the intervention had been targeted for their use. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of included studies. Where possible, we contacted study authors to obtain missing information. Main results We identified 24 studies that enrolled a total of 8112 participants. However, there was significant heterogeneity in the comparators used and the outcomes measured, which limited the ability to pool data. Many of the studies did not report sufficient information in their methods to allow judgment of their risk of bias. From the information that was reported, three of the studies had a high risk of selection bias and one was at high risk of bias due to lack of blinding of the outcome assessors. None of the included studies reported the minimum clinically important difference for the outcomes that were measured. We have therefore reported results from the studies but have been unable to interpret whether differences were of clinical importance. The main findings of the review are as follows. Knowledge: There is low quality evidence that multimedia education was more effective than usual care (non‐standardised education provided as part of usual clinical care) or no education (standardised mean difference (SMD) 1.04, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.49 to1.58, six studies with 817 participants). There was considerable statistical heterogeneity (I 2  = 89%), however, all but one of the studies favoured the multimedia group. There is moderate quality evidence that multimedia education was not more effective at improving knowledge than control multimedia interventions (i.e. multimedia programs that do not provide information about the medication) (mean difference (MD) of knowledge scores 2.78%, 95% CI ‐1.48 to 7.0, two studies with 568 participants). There is moderate quality evidence that multimedia education was more effective when added to a co‐intervention (written information or brief standardised instructions provided by a health professional) compared with the co‐intervention alone (MD of knowledge scores 24.59%, 95% CI 22.34 to 26.83, two studies with 381 participants). Skill acquisition: There is moderate quality evidence that multimedia education was more effective than usual care or no education (MD of inhaler technique score 18.32%, 95% CI 11.92 to 24.73, two studies with 94 participants) and written education (risk ratio (RR) of improved inhaler technique 2.14, 95% CI 1.33 to 3.44, two studies with 164 participants). There is very low quality evidence that multimedia education was equally effective as education by a health professional (MD of inhaler technique score ‐1.01%, 95% CI ‐15.75 to 13.72, three studies with 130 participants). Compliance with medications: There is moderate quality evidence that there was no difference between multimedia education and usual care or no education (RR of complying 1.02, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.08, two studies with 4552 participants). We could not determine the effect of multimedia education on other outcomes, including patient satisfaction, self‐efficacy and health outcomes, due to an inadequate number of studies from which to draw conclusions. Authors' conclusions This review provides evidence that multimedia education about medications is more effective than usual care (non‐standardised education provided by health professionals as part of usual clinical care) or no education, in improving both knowledge and skill acquisition. It also suggests that multimedia education is at least equivalent to other forms of education, including written education and education provided by a health professional. However, this finding is based on often low quality evidence from a small number of trials. Multimedia education about medications could therefore be considered as an adjunct to usual care but there is inadequate evidence to recommend it as a replacement for written education or education by a health professional. Multimedia education may be considered as an alternative to education provided by a health professional, particularly in settings where provision of detailed education by a health professional is not feasible. More studies evaluating multimedia educational interventions are required in order to increase confidence in the estimate of effect of the intervention. Conclusions regarding the effect of multimedia education were limited by the lack of information provided by study authors about the educational interventions, and variability in their content and quality. Studies testing educational interventions should provide detailed information about the interventions and comparators. Research is required to establish a framework that is specific for the evaluation of the quality of multimedia educational programs. Conclusions were also limited by the heterogeneity in the outcomes reported and the instruments used to measure them. Research is required to identify a core set of outcomes which should be measured when evaluating patient educational interventions. Future research should use consistent, reliable and validated outcome measures so that comparisons can be made between studies. Plain language summary Multimedia programs for educating patients about medications Consumers need detailed information about their medications to enable them to use their medications safely and effectively. For information to be useful it needs to be presented in a format that can be easily understood by consumers. There is evidence that methods such as spoken communication between the health provider and consumer and written materials are not meeting consumers’ needs. Multimedia education programs use more than one format to provide information. This could include using written words, diagrams and pictures with the use of audio, animation or video. They can be provided using different technologies, such as DVD and CD‐ROM, or can be accessed over the Internet. This review presents the evidence from 24 studies, involving 8112 participants, of multimedia education programs about medications. We found that multimedia education programs about medications are superior to no education or education provided as part of usual clinical care in improving patient knowledge. There was wide variability in the results from the six studies that compared multimedia education to usual care or no education. However, all but one of the six studies favoured multimedia education. We also found that multimedia education is superior to usual care or no education in improving skill levels. The review also suggested that multimedia was at least as effective as other forms of education, including written education or brief education from a health provider. However, these findings were based on a small number of studies, many of which were of low quality. Multimedia education did not improve compliance with medications (i.e. the degree to which a patient correctly follows advice about his or her medication) compared with usual care or no education. We could not determine the effect of multimedia education on other outcomes, such as patient satisfaction, self‐efficacy (confidence in their ability to perform health‐related tasks) and health outcomes. The review findings therefore suggests that multimedia education programs about medications could be used alongside usual care provided by health providers. There is not enough evidence to recommend it as a replacement for written education or education by a health professional. Multimedia education could be used instead of detailed education given by a health provider when it is not possible or practical for health professionals to provide this service. This review found that there were differences between the types of education provided to the control groups and what results were measured. This limited the ability to summarise results across studies, so most of the conclusions of this review were based on results from a small number of studies. More studies of multimedia educational programs are needed to make the results of this review more reliable.","4","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; *Multimedia; Humans; Medication Adherence; Nonprescription Drugs [*therapeutic use]; Patient Education as Topic [*methods, standards]; Prescription Drugs [*therapeutic use]; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic","10.1002/14651858.CD008416.pub2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD008416.pub2","Consumers and Communication"

Provision is framed within the context of a rapidly changing population profile, which is impacting on the number of people requiring health and social care, workforce availability and the funding of healthcare systems. Objectives To explore the effectiveness of smart home technologies as an intervention for people with physical disability, cognitive impairment or learning disability, who are living at home, and to consider the impact on the individual's health status and on the financial resources of health care. Search methods We searched the following databases for primary studies: (a) the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC) Group Register, (b) the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), ( The Cochrane Library,  issue 1, 2007), and (c) bibliographic databases, including MEDLINE (1966 to March 2007), EMBASE (1980 to March 2007) and CINAHL (1982 to March 2007). We also searched the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness (DARE). We searched the electronic databases using a strategy developed by the EPOC Trials Search Co‐ordinator. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi‐experimental studies, controlled before and after studies (CBAs) and interrupted time series analyses (ITS). Participants included adults over the age of 18, living in their home in a community setting. Participants with a physical disability, dementia or a learning disability were included. The included interventions were social alarms, electronic assistive devices, telecare social alert platforms, environmental control systems, automated home environments and 'ubiquitous homes'. Outcome measures included any objective measure that records an impact on a participant's quality of life, healthcare professional workload, economic outcomes, costs to healthcare provider or costs to participant. We included measures of service satisfaction, device satisfaction and healthcare professional attitudes or satisfaction. Data collection and analysis One review author completed the search strategy with the support of a life and health sciences librarian. Two review authors independently screened titles and abstracts of results. Main results No studies were identified which met the inclusion criteria. Authors' conclusions This review highlights the current lack of empirical evidence to support or refute the use of smart home technologies within health and social care, which is significant for practitioners and healthcare consumers. Plain language summary The effect of smart home technologies to support people at home People who are ill (physically or mentally), or who are frail, may find it difficult to meet their everyday personal and social needs at home. Healthcare providers are trying to find ways to support more people at home, but finding home care workers and the money to fund this help is challenging. Advances in technology have created new devices to help support people.  New devices are already starting to be used, such as mobile phones tailored to health care, or electronic sensors that sound alarms in emergency situations. Another new technology is sensors. Sensors can be placed in everyday appliances in the home, like the fridge, cooker or the door, and can send information to healthcare providers.  Providers can find out how people are doing in their homes and then make decisions about their care, such as how often to visit the home. Homes with these technologies are called 'smart homes'. As with many new technologies, smart home technologies are often used without first testing if they are effective. This review aimed to determine what effect any type of smart home technologies have on people. The review produced a significant volume of literature on the use of smart technologies within health care, but there were no studies testing their effectiveness. The effects of smart technologies to support people in their homes are not known. Better quality research is needed.

"CD011812.PUB2","Jordan, J; Rose, L; Dainty, KN; Noyes, J; Blackwood, B","Factors that impact on the use of mechanical ventilation weaning protocols in critically ill adults and children: a qualitative evidence‐synthesis","Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","2016","Abstract - Background Prolonged mechanical ventilation is associated with a longer intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay and higher mortality. Consequently, methods to improve ventilator weaning processes have been sought. Two recent Cochrane systematic reviews in ICU adult and paediatric populations concluded that protocols can be effective in reducing the duration of mechanical ventilation, but there was significant heterogeneity in study findings. Growing awareness of the benefits of understanding the contextual factors impacting on effectiveness has encouraged the integration of qualitative evidence syntheses with effectiveness reviews, which has delivered important insights into the reasons underpinning (differential) effectiveness of healthcare interventions. Objectives 1. To locate, appraise and synthesize qualitative evidence concerning the barriers and facilitators of the use of protocols for weaning critically‐ill adults and children from mechanical ventilation; 2. To integrate this synthesis with two Cochrane effectiveness reviews of protocolized weaning to help explain observed heterogeneity by identifying contextual factors that impact on the use of protocols for weaning critically‐ill adults and children from mechanical ventilation; 3. To use the integrated body of evidence to suggest the circumstances in which weaning protocols are most likely to be used. Search methods We used a range of search terms identified with the help of the SPICE (Setting, Perspective, Intervention, Comparison, Evaluation) mnemonic. Where available, we used appropriate methodological filters for specific databases. We searched the following databases: Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, OVID, PsycINFO, CINAHL Plus, EBSCOHost, Web of Science Core Collection, ASSIA, IBSS, Sociological Abstracts, ProQuest and LILACS on the 26th February 2015. In addition, we searched: the grey literature; the websites of professional associations for relevant publications; and the reference lists of all publications reviewed. We also contacted authors of the trials included in the effectiveness reviews as well as of studies (potentially) included in the qualitative synthesis, conducted citation searches of the publications reporting these studies, and contacted content experts. We reran the search on 3rd July 2016 and found three studies, which are awaiting classification. Selection criteria We included qualitative studies that described: the circumstances in which protocols are designed, implemented or used, or both, and the views and experiences of healthcare professionals either involved in the design, implementation or use of weaning protocols or involved in the weaning of critically‐ill adults and children from mechanical ventilation not using protocols. We included studies that: reflected on any aspect of the use of protocols, explored contextual factors relevant to the development, implementation or use of weaning protocols, and reported contextual phenomena and outcomes identified as relevant to the effectiveness of protocolized weaning from mechanical ventilation. Data collection and analysis At each stage, two review authors undertook designated tasks, with the results shared amongst the wider team for discussion and final development. We independently reviewed all retrieved titles, abstracts and full papers for inclusion, and independently extracted selected data from included studies. We used the findings of the included studies to develop a new set of analytic themes focused on the barriers and facilitators to the use of protocols, and further refined them to produce a set of summary statements. We used the Confidence in the Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative Research (CERQual) framework to arrive at a final assessment of the overall confidence of the evidence used in the synthesis. We included all studies but undertook two sensitivity analyses to determine how the removal of certain bodies of evidence impacted on the content and confidence of the synthesis. We deployed a logic model to integrate the findings of the qualitative evidence synthesis with those of the Cochrane effectiveness reviews. Main results We included 11 studies in our synthesis, involving 267 participants (one study did not report the number of participants). Five more studies are awaiting classification and will be dealt with when we update the review. The quality of the evidence was mixed; of the 35 summary statements, we assessed 17 as ‘low’, 13 as ‘moderate’ and five as ‘high’ confidence. Our synthesis produced nine analytical themes, which report potential barriers and facilitators to the use of protocols. The themes are: the need for continual staff training and development; clinical experience as this promotes felt and perceived competence and confidence to wean; the vulnerability of weaning to disparate interprofessional working; an understanding of protocols as militating against a necessary proactivity in clinical practice; perceived nursing scope of practice and professional risk; ICU structure and processes of care; the ability of protocols to act as a prompt for shared care and consistency in weaning practice; maximizing the use of protocols through visibility and ease of implementation; and the ability of protocols to act as a framework for communication with parents. Authors' conclusions There is a clear need for weaning protocols to take account of the social and cultural environment in which they are to be implemented. Irrespective of its inherent strengths, a protocol will not be used if it does not accommodate these complexities. In terms of protocol development, comprehensive interprofessional input will help to ensure broad‐based understanding and a sense of ‘ownership’. In terms of implementation, all relevant ICU staff will benefit from general weaning as well as protocol‐specific training; not only will this help secure a relevant clinical knowledge base and operational understanding, but will also demonstrate to others that this knowledge and understanding is in place. In order to maximize relevance and acceptability, protocols should be designed with the patient profile and requirements of the target ICU in mind. Predictably, an under‐resourced ICU will impact adversely on protocol implementation, as staff will prioritize management of acutely deteriorating and critically‐ill patients. Plain language summary Using qualitative evidence to identify factors influencing ICU health carers' use of guidelines to take adults and children off mechanical ventilation Background Many critically‐ill adults and children being cared for in an intensive care unit (ICU) are unable to breathe by themselves. When this happens they are put on a mechanical ventilator, a machine that helps them to breathe. Staying on a ventilator for too long increases the likelihood of harmful effects, including trauma and infection of the lungs and complications of prolonged immobility such as blood clots in the legs or lungs. Consequently, researchers have tried to find ways to take people off ventilators (that is, to wean them) as soon as is safely possible. One way is by using guidelines, or  protocols.  Two recent Cochrane reviews combined evidence from different research studies. Some studies showed that protocols were successful in reducing the amount of time spent on a ventilator, while other studies showed that using protocols did not make any difference to the amount of time spent on a ventilator. These contrasting findings could have been caused by a range of factors. Researchers investigating these factors have used qualitative research methods, which usually involve talking to people or observing how people behave, or both. Review question What are the factors influencing how healthcare professionals use protocols to wean adults and children from mechanical ventilation? Methods To identify studies using qualitative methods, we searched relevant electronic databases of journals in February 2015. We also searched the reference lists of articles, contacted the authors of all of the studies included in the two earlier reviews and in our qualitative synthesis, and contacted experts in mechanical ventilation. We combined the findings of the relevant studies to produce a synthesis of the evidence on what influences health professionals to use protocols. We then combined our synthesis with the findings of the two earlier reviews to help explain why some of the studies had shown protocols to be effective and others had not. We were able to do so by producing explanations of how different factors work together to either promote or hinder the use of protocols. We outlined these explanations in a ‘logic model’. Key findings Our synthesis included 11 studies, involving around 267 participants; five more studies are awaiting classification. We identified several potential barriers and facilitators to the use of protocols. First, doctors used protocols only in certain circumstances; otherwise they preferred to wean using their own knowledge and skills. Relatively inexperienced nurses often lacked confidence. A protocol could encourage their involvement in weaning because it set out clear instructions and also helped them to feel more secure. Although more experienced nurses also recognized these positive qualities, they criticized protocols as sometimes instructing them to wean contrary to their own clinical judgement. Second, the practical arrangements for care within an ICU could either help or hinder healthcare professionals to work together, and in this way influence how (well) a protocol was used. Third, the use of a protocol reflected how healthcare professionals interact with one another generally. For example, the degree of experience a nurse or doctor possessed could influence the confidence others had that they could wean safely. For this reason, doctors tended to be reluctant to involve nurses they considered to be relatively inexperienced in weaning, even when there was a protocol in place. Furthermore, the fact that doctors occupied a higher professional status or position meant that it was difficult for nurses to be involved in weaning, including by using a protocol, unless the doctors s/he worked with permitted this to happen. Quality of the evidence We developed 35 summary statements. Of these: we assessed 17 statements as ‘low’ confidence, largely because the evidence used to develop them came from only a small number of studies. We rated 13 statements as ‘moderate’ confidence, largely because the evidence used to develop them came from very well‐conducted studies, and we rated five statements as ‘high’ confidence, largely because the evidence used to develop them came from a majority of the studies.","10","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Critical Care; Adult; Child; Clinical Protocols; Critical Illness; Evidence‐Based Practice; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Qualitative Research; Respiration, Artificial [adverse effects]; Staff Development; Ventilator Weaning [*methods]","10.1002/14651858.CD011812.pub2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD011812.pub2","Emergency and Critical Care"

Studies have indicated that early symptoms that are idiosyncratic to the person with schizophrenia (early warning signs) often precede acute psychotic relapse. Early warning signs interventions propose that learning to detect and manage early warning signs of impending relapse might prevent or delay acute psychotic relapse. Objectives To compare the effectiveness of early warning signs interventions plus treatment as usual involving and not involving a psychological therapy on time to relapse, hospitalisation, functioning, negative and positive symptomatology. Search methods Search databases included the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (July 2007 and May 2012) which is based on regular searches of BIOSIS, CENTRAL, CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE and PsycINFO. References of all identified studies were reviewed for inclusion. We inspected the UK National Research Registe and contacted relevant pharmaceutical companies and authors of trials for additional information. Selection criteria We included all randomised clinical trials (RCTs) comparing early warning signs interventions plus treatment as usual to treatment as usual for people with schizophrenia or other non‐affective psychosis Data collection and analysis We assessed included studies for quality and extracted data. If more than 50% of participants were lost to follow‐up, the study was excluded. For binary outcomes, we calculated standard estimates of risk ratio (RR) and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI), for continuous outcomes, we calculated mean differences (MD) with standard errors estimated, and for time to event outcomes we calculated Cox proportional hazards ratios (HRs) and associated 95 % CI. We assessed risk of bias for included studies and assessed overall study quality using the GRADE approach. Main results Thirty‐two RCTs and two cluster‐RCTs that randomised 3554 people satisfied criteria for inclusion. Only one study examined the effects of early warning signs interventions without additional psychological interventions, and many of the outcomes for this review were not reported or poorly‐reported. Significantly fewer people relapsed with early warning signs interventions than with usual care (23% versus 43%; RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.79; 15 RCTs, 1502 participants;  very low quality evidence ). Time to relapse did not significantly differ between intervention groups (6 RCTs, 550 participants;  very low quality evidence ). Risk of re‐hospitalisation was significantly lower with early warning signs interventions compared to usual care (19% versus 39%; RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.66; 15 RCTS, 1457 participants;  very low quality evidence ). Time to re‐hospitalisation did not significantly differ between intervention groups (6 RCTs; 1149 participants;  very low quality evidence ). Participants' satisfaction with care and economic costs were inconclusive because of a lack of evidence. Authors' conclusions This review indicates that early warning signs interventions may have a positive effect on the proportions of people re‐hospitalised and on rates of relapse, but not on time to recurrence. However, the overall quality of the evidence was very low, indicating that we do not know if early warning signs interventions will have similar effects outside trials and that it is very likely that further research will alter these estimates. Moreover, the early warning signs interventions were used along side other psychological interventions, and we do not know if they would be effective on their own. They may be cost‐effective due to reduced hospitalisation and relapse rates, but before mental health services consider routinely providing psychological interventions involving the early recognition and prompt management of early warning signs to adults with schizophrenia, further research is required to provide evidence of high or moderate quality regarding the efficacy of early warning signs interventions added to usual care without additional psychological interventions, or to clarify the kinds of additional psychological interventions that might aid its efficacy. Future RCTs should be adequately‐powered, and designed to minimise the risk of bias and be transparently reported. They should also systematically evaluate resource costs and resource use, alongside efficacy outcomes and other outcomes that are important to people with serious mental illness and their carers. Plain language summary Training to recognise the early signs of recurrence in schizophrenia Many people with schizophrenia experience periods of illness followed by relatively stable periods (although symptoms of illness such as hearing voices and seeing things often remain in the background). This means that many people with schizophrenia may become unwell again and need to go back into hospital. Training in early warning signs techniques encourages people to learn, detect and recognise the early warning signs of future illness. Studies indicate that noticing even small changes in signs and symptoms of schizophrenia can often predict future illness and relapse two to 10 weeks later. Early warning training may help to prevent or delay relapse, so reducing the chances of going into hospital. Recognition of early warning signs requires detailed history taking, sometimes with additional techniques such as diary keeping, completion of questionnaires and a plan of action based on anticipated early warning signs. Training can be undertaken by the individual or be group‐based, involving health professionals, family members or carers. Successful training seems to require around 12 sessions and involves therapists of high competency.     This review includes a total of 34 studies. It found that there are positive benefits of training in early warning signs. It reduces rates of relapse and re‐hospitalisation (but not on time to recurrence). It should be noted that training in early warning signs was mainly used alongside other psychological therapies, so it is not entirely clear what proportion of the positive effect is due to training in early warning signs alone. Moreover, the overall quality of the evidence from these studies was judged to be very low. This means that we do not know if interventions using early warning signs, with or without additional psychological treatments, will have the same beneficial effects outside clinical trials.     Further research is required to decide whether training in early warning signs is effective on its own. Effects on quality of life, satisfaction with care, money spent, and burden of care for carers are unclear, so ideally should be known before training programmes are put into wider use. At this time, there is not enough evidence to support training in early warning signs alone.

This is an updated version of the original Cochrane Review published in Issue 10, 2017. Objectives To assess the impact of psychological treatments for people with epilepsy on HRQOL outcomes. Search methods For this update, we searched the following databases on 12 August 2019, without language restrictions: Cochrane Register of Studies (CRS Web), which includes randomized or quasi‐randomized controlled trials from the Specialized Registers of Cochrane Review Groups including Epilepsy, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (Ovid, 1946 to 09 August 2019), and PsycINFO (EBSCOhost, 1887 onwards), and from PubMed, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). We screened the references from included studies and relevant reviews, and contacted researchers in the field for unpublished studies. Selection criteria We considered randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs for this review. HRQOL was the main outcome. For the operational definition of 'psychological treatments', we included a broad range of skills‐based psychological treatments and education‐only interventions designed to improve HRQOL, seizure frequency and severity, as well as psychiatric and behavioral health comorbidities for adults and children with epilepsy. These psychological treatments were compared to treatment as usual (TAU), an active control group (such as social support group), or antidepressant pharmacotherapy. Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Main results We included 36 completed RCTs, with a total of 3526 participants. Of these studies, 27 investigated skills‐based psychological interventions. The remaining nine studies were education‐only interventions. Six studies investigated interventions for children and adolescents, three studies investigated interventions for adolescents and adults, and the remaining studies investigated interventions for adults. Based on satisfactory clinical and methodological homogeneity, we pooled data from 11 studies (643 participants) that used the Quality of Life in Epilepsy‐31 (QOLIE‐31) or other QOLIE inventories (such as QOLIE‐89 or QOLIE‐31‐P) convertible to QOLIE‐31. We found significant mean changes for the QOLIE‐31 total score and six subscales (emotional well‐being, energy and fatigue, overall QoL, seizure worry, medication effects, and cognitive functioning). The mean changes in the QOLIE‐31 total score (mean improvement of 5.23 points, 95% CI 3.02 to 7.44; P < 0.001), and the overall QoL score (mean improvement of 5.95 points, 95% CI 3.05 to 8.85; P < 0.001) exceeded the threshold of minimally important change (MIC: total score: 4.73 points; QoL score: 5.22 points), indicating a clinically meaningful postintervention improvement in HRQOL. We downgraded the certainty of the evidence provided by the meta‐analysis due to serious risks of bias in some of the included studies. Consequently, these results provided moderate‐certainty evidence that psychological treatments for adults with epilepsy may enhance overall HRQOL. Authors' conclusions Implications for practice: Skills‐based psychological interventions improve HRQOL in adults and adolescents with epilepsy. Adjunctive use of skills‐based psychological treatments for adults and adolescents with epilepsy may provide additional benefits in HRQOL when these are incorporated into patient‐centered management. We judge the evidence to be of moderate certainty. Implications for research: Investigators should strictly adhere to the CONSORT guidelines to improve the quality of reporting on their interventions. A thorough description of intervention protocols is necessary to ensure reproducibility. When examining the effectiveness of psychological treatments for people with epilepsy, the use of standardized HRQOL inventories, such as the Quality of Life in Epilepsy Inventories (QOLIE‐31, QOLIE‐31‐P, and QOLIE‐89) would increase comparability. Unfortunately, there is a critical gap in pediatric RCTs and RCTs including people with epilepsy and intellectual disabilities. Finally, in order to increase the overall quality of RCT study designs, adequate randomization with allocation concealment and blinded outcome assessment should be pursued. As attrition is often high in research that requires active participation, an intention‐to‐treat analysis should be carried out. Treatment fidelity and treatment competence should also be assessed. These important dimensions, which are related to 'Risk of bias' assessment, should always be reported. Plain language summary Psychological treatments for people with epilepsy Review question In this Cochrane Review, we wanted to find out if the well‐being (quality of life) of people with epilepsy could be improved by participation in educational or skills‐based psychological therapies. Why is this important? Epilepsy is a brain‐condition in which sudden bursts of intense electrical activity happen in the brain and cause the brain's messages to get mixed up, resulting in a seizure. Seizures affect people in different ways: they may cause unusual sensations, movements or feelings, loss of awareness, falls, stiffness or jerking. Epileptic seizures can occur repeatedly and without any triggers. Seizures can happen anytime and anywhere; they can come on suddenly and can happen often. Epilepsy can significantly impact a person’s wellbeing and quality of life. For instance, many people with epilepsy experience depression and anxiety, memory problems, unemployment and discrimination, adverse side effects from medications, challenges to independence and worries about seizures and their consequences. Treatments for epilepsy typically focus on stopping or reducing the number of seizures a person has with as little side effects as possible. However, psychological therapies, usually delivered by psychologists, psychiatrists or other healthcare professionals could improve well‐being in people with epilepsy. What did we do? On 12 August 2019, we searched research databases for studies that measured the effects of psychological therapy offered to people with epilepsy on their quality of life. We found 36 studies, which involved 3,526 people with epilepsy. Participants of most studies were adults (27 studies); only three studies included adolescents and adults, and six involved children and adolescents. Most studies (27) measured the effects of “skills‐based” psychological therapies. These treatments teach people skills they can use in their daily lives. The treatment approaches of skills‐based therapies included: cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) including CBT techniques such as breathing, reasoning or visualizing; counseling; and exercises in mindfulness. The other nine studies measured educational therapies. These treatments aimed to increase people’s knowledge of epilepsy and related conditions, treatments for epilepsy, or about how the brain works. The studies compared the effects of the psychological therapies with a person's usual care, antidepressant medicines or social support. The 36 studies had different designs and assessed people's quality of life using different scales, so we couldn't compare them all. However, we were able to compare the results of 11 studies of skills‐based therapies because they used the same scale to assess quality of life. What did we find? The 11 studies (involving 643 adults and adolescents) were conducted in Europe (3 studies), the USA (4), Hong Kong (2), Mexico (1) and Australia (1). People in the studies were followed and assessed from 12 weeks to 2 years. The 11 studies measured different aspects of quality of life. People received skills‐based psychological therapies reported better quality of life overall than those who received usual care (8 studies), social support (2) or antidepressant medicines (1). Ten of these 11 studies also looked at subscales of the quality of life questionnaires to assess specific aspects of quality of life. People in these studies reported better results on the six subscales, ‐ emotional well‐being, energy and fatigue, overall well‐being, seizure worries, medication effects, and social function, which are combined to calculated overall quality of life. Key messages We concluded that skills‐based psychological therapies may improve well‐being (quality of life) in adults and adolescents with epilepsy. We are moderately confident in our result from these 11 studies of psychological therapies in people with epilepsy. We believe that more studies on this specific outcome of quality of life would be unlikely to change our findings.

There is potential to improve health care quality if nurses routinely use the best available evidence in their clinical practice. Since many of the factors perceived by nurses as barriers to the implementation of evidence‐based practice (EBP) lie at the organisational level, it is of interest to devise and assess the effectiveness of organisational infrastructures designed to promote EBP among nurses. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of organisational infrastructures in promoting evidence‐based nursing. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC) Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, LILACS, BIREME, IBECS, NHS Economic Evaluations Database, Social Science Citation Index, Science Citation Index and Conference Proceedings Citation Indexes up to 9 March 2011. We developed a new search strategy for this update as the strategy published in 2003 omitted key terms. Additional search methods included: screening reference lists of relevant studies, contacting authors of relevant papers regarding any further published or unpublished work, and searching websites of selected research groups and organisations.  Selection criteria We considered randomised controlled trials, controlled clinical trials, interrupted times series (ITSs) and controlled before and after studies of an entire or identified component of an organisational infrastructure intervention aimed at promoting EBP in nursing. The participants were all healthcare organisations comprising nurses, midwives and health visitors. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. For the ITS analysis, we reported the change in the slopes of the regression lines, and the change in the level effect of the outcome at 3, 6, 12 and 24 months follow‐up. Main results We included one study from the USA (re‐analysed as an ITS) involving one hospital and an unknown number of nurses and patients. The study evaluated the effects of a standardised evidence‐based nursing procedure on nursing care for patients at risk of developing healthcare‐acquired pressure ulcers (HAPUs). If a patient's admission Braden score was below or equal to 18 (i.e. indicating a high risk of developing pressure ulcers), nurses were authorised to initiate a pressure ulcer prevention bundle (i.e. a set of evidence‐based clinical interventions) without waiting for a physician order. Re‐analysis of data as a time series showed that against a background trend of decreasing HAPU rates, if that trend was assumed to be real, there was no evidence of an intervention effect at three months (mean rate per quarter 0.7%; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.7 to 3.3; P = 0.457). Given the small percentages post intervention it was not statistically possible to extrapolate effects beyond three months. Authors' conclusions Despite extensive searching of published and unpublished research we identified only one low‐quality study; we excluded many studies due to non‐eligible study design. If policy‐makers and healthcare organisations wish to promote evidence‐based nursing successfully at an organisational level, they must ensure the funding and conduct of well‐designed studies to generate evidence to guide policy. Plain language summary Can organisational infrastructures be effective in promoting evidence‐based nursing practice? Nurses and midwives form the bulk of the clinical health workforce, and play a central role in all health service delivery. There is potential to improve health care quality if nurses routinely use the best available evidence in their clinical practice. Since many of the factors perceived by nurses as barriers to the implementation of evidence‐based practice (EBP) lie at the organisational level, it is of interest to devise and assess the effectiveness of models to change healthcare organisations in order to promote the use of EBP among nurses successfully. We defined organisational infrastructures as being ""the underlying foundation or basic framework through which clinical care is delivered and supported"", which include for example: organisational policies, nurse development units and other types of organisational developments such as organisations developing and implementing evidence‐based nursing procedures, standards or guidelines for clinical practice. We searched the literature for robust evaluations of the effectiveness of organisational interventions in promoting EBP in nursing. We included one study from the USA which involved one hospital and for which the number of nurses was not reported. The study evaluated the effects of a standardised evidence‐based nursing procedure on improved nursing care for patients at risk of developing healthcare‐acquired pressure ulcers (HAPUs), as measured by the HAPU rate. If a patient's admission Braden score was lower than or equal to 18, nurses were authorised to initiate a prevention pressure ulcer care bundle, without a physician order. The Braden scale is a tool used to assess a patient's risk of developing pressure ulcers. An adult with a score below or equal to 18 is considered to have a high risk for developing a pressure ulcer. Re‐analysis of the HAPU data, as an interrupted time series, was suggestive of a trend in rates prior to intervention and, if that trend was assumed to be real, there was no evidence of an intervention effect at three months (mean rate per quarter 0.7%; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.7 to 3.3; P = 0.457). Given the small percentages post intervention it was not statistically possible to extrapolate effects beyond three months. Considering the importance placed on organisational change in promoting EBP in nursing, it is surprising that eight years after the previous empty Cochrane review was published, appropriately evaluated organisational infrastructure interventions are still lacking. If policy‐makers and healthcare organisations wish to promote evidence‐based nursing at an organisational level successfully, they must ensure the funding and conduct of well‐designed studies to generate evidence to guide policy.","2","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Efficiency, Organizational; Evidence‐Based Nursing [*methods]; Humans; Nursing Care [*standards]; Outcome and Process Assessment, Health Care [standards]; Pressure Ulcer [prevention & control]","10.1002/14651858.CD002212.pub2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD002212.pub2","Effective Practice and Organisation of Care"

Employees who have been bullied have lower levels of job satisfaction, higher levels of anxiety and depression, and are more likely to leave their place of work. Organisations face increased risk of skill depletion and absenteeism, leading to loss of profit, potential legal fees, and tribunal cases. It is unclear to what extent these risks can be addressed through interventions to prevent bullying. Objectives To explore the effectiveness of workplace interventions to prevent bullying in the workplace. Search methods We searched: the Cochrane Work Group Trials Register (August 2014); Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL;  The Cochrane Library  2016, issue 1); PUBMED (1946 to January 2016); EMBASE (1980 to January 2016); PsycINFO (1967 to January 2016); Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL Plus; 1937 to January 2016); International Bibliography of the Social Sciences (IBSS; 1951 to January 2016); Applied Social Sciences Index and Abstracts (ASSIA; 1987 to January 2016); ABI Global (earliest record to January 2016); Business Source Premier (BSP; earliest record to January 2016); OpenGrey (previously known as OpenSIGLE‐System for Information on Grey Literature in Europe; 1980 to December 2014); and reference lists of articles. Selection criteria Randomised and cluster‐randomised controlled trials of employee‐directed interventions, controlled before and after studies, and interrupted time‐series studies of interventions of any type, aimed at preventing bullying in the workplace, targeted at an individual employee, a group of employees, or an organisation. Data collection and analysis Three authors independently screened and selected studies. We extracted data from included studies on victimisation, perpetration, and absenteeism associated with workplace bullying. We contacted study authors to gather additional data. We used the internal validity items from the Downs and Black quality assessment tool to evaluate included studies' risk of bias. Main results Five studies met the inclusion criteria. They had altogether 4116 participants. They were underpinned by theory and measured behaviour change in relation to bullying and related absenteeism. The included studies measured the effectiveness of interventions on the number of cases of self‐reported bullying either as perpetrator or victim or both. Some studies referred to bullying using common synonyms such as mobbing and incivility and antonyms such as civility. Organisational/employer level interventions Two studies with 2969 participants found that the Civility, Respect, and Engagement in the Workforce (CREW) intervention produced a small increase in civility that translates to a 5% increase from baseline to follow‐up, measured at 6 to 12 months (mean difference (MD) 0.17; 95% CI 0.07 to 0.28). One of the two studies reported that the CREW intervention produced a small decrease in supervisor incivility victimisation (MD ‐0.17; 95% CI ‐0.33 to ‐0.01) but not in co‐worker incivility victimisation (MD ‐0.08; 95% CI ‐0.22 to 0.08) or in self‐reported incivility perpetration (MD ‐0.05 95% CI ‐0.15 to 0.05). The study did find a decrease in the number of days absent during the previous month (MD ‐0.63; 95% CI ‐0.92 to ‐0.34) at 6‐month follow‐up. Individual/job interface level interventions One controlled before‐after study with 49 participants compared expressive writing with a control writing exercise at two weeks follow‐up. Participants in the intervention arm scored significantly lower on bullying measured as incivility perpetration (MD ‐3.52; 95% CI ‐6.24 to ‐0.80). There was no difference in bullying measured as incivility victimisation (MD ‐3.30 95% CI ‐6.89 to 0.29). One controlled before‐after study with 60 employees who had learning disabilities compared a cognitive‐behavioural intervention with no intervention. There was no significant difference in bullying victimisation after the intervention (risk ratio (RR) 0.55; 95% CI 0.24 to 1.25), or at the three‐month follow‐up (RR 0.49; 95% CI 0.21 to 1.15), nor was there a significant difference in bullying perpetration following the intervention (RR 0.64; 95% CI 0.27 to 1.54), or at the three‐month follow‐up (RR 0.69; 95% CI 0.26 to 1.81). Multilevel Interventions A five‐site cluster‐RCT with 1041 participants compared the effectiveness of combinations of policy communication, stress management training, and negative behaviours awareness training. The authors reported that bullying victimisation did not change (13.6% before intervention and 14.3% following intervention). The authors reported insufficient data for us to conduct our own analysis. Due to high risk of bias and imprecision, we graded the evidence for all outcomes as very low quality. Authors' conclusions There is very low quality evidence that organisational and individual interventions may prevent bullying behaviours in the workplace. We need large well‐designed controlled trials of bullying prevention interventions operating on the levels of society/policy, organisation/employer, job/task and individual/job interface. Future studies should employ validated and reliable outcome measures of bullying and a minimum of 6 months follow‐up. Plain language summary Are there ways in which workplace bullying can be prevented? Background Bullying in the workplace can reduce the mental health of working people. It can also harm the organisations where these people work. There has been much research about bullying in the workplace. However, most studies have looked at how to manage bullying once it has happened, rather than trying to stop it happening in the first place. Many people who have been bullied choose to leave their job rather than face up to the bully. It is important to know if the actions workplaces take to prevent bullying are effective. Our review question What are the benefits of different ways of trying to prevent bullying in the workplace? What the studies showed We included five studies conducted with 4116 participants that measured being victim of bullying or being a bully and consequences of bullying such as absenteeism. We classified two interventions as organisational‐level, two as individual‐level and one as multi‐level. There were no studies about interventions conducted at the society/policy level. Organisational‐level interventions Two studies found that organisational interventions increased civility, the opposite of bullying, by about five percent. One of these studies also showed a reduction in coworker and supervisor incivility. They also found that the average time off work reduced by over one third of a day per month. Individual‐level interventions An expressive writing task with 46 employees, showed a reduction in the amount of bullying. A cognitive behavioural educational intervention was conducted with 60 employees who had a learning disability, but there was no significant change in bullying. Multilevel interventions One study evaluated a combination of education and policy interventions across five organisations and found no significant change in bullying. What is the bottom line? This review shows that organisational and individual interventions may prevent bullying in the workplace. However, the evidence is of very low quality. We need studies that use better ways to measure the effect of all kinds of interventions to prevent bullying.","1","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Absenteeism; Bullying [*prevention & control]; Cognitive Behavioral Therapy; Controlled Before‐After Studies; Humans; Organizational Culture; Organizational Policy; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Social Skills; Workplace [*psychology]","10.1002/14651858.CD009778.pub2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD009778.pub2","Work"

The follow‐up time ranged from two‐and‐a‐half to 24 months and the content of the interventions was diverse. Participants' mean age ranged from 57 to 74 years, and the proportion of male participants ranged from 33% to 98%. The post‐bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) to forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio of participants ranged from 33.6% to 57.0%. The FEV1/FVC ratio is a measure used to diagnose COPD and to determine the severity of the disease. Studies were conducted on four different continents (Europe (n = 15), North America (n = 8), Asia (n = 1), and Oceania (n = 4); with one study conducted in both Europe and Oceania). Self‐management interventions likely improve HRQoL, as measured by the St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) total score (lower score represents better HRQoL) with a mean difference (MD) from usual care of ‐2.86 points (95% confidence interval (CI) ‐4.87 to ‐0.85; 14 studies, 2778 participants; low‐quality evidence). The pooled MD of ‐2.86 did not reach the SGRQ minimal clinically important difference (MCID) of four points. Self‐management intervention participants were also at a slightly lower risk for at least one respiratory‐related hospital admission (odds ratio (OR) 0.75, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.98; 15 studies, 3263 participants; very low‐quality evidence). The number needed to treat to prevent one respiratory‐related hospital admission over a mean of 9.75 months' follow‐up was 15 (95% CI 8 to 399) for participants with high baseline risk and 26 (95% CI 15 to 677) for participants with low baseline risk. No differences were observed in respiratory‐related mortality (risk difference (RD) 0.01, 95% CI ‐0.02 to 0.04; 8 studies, 1572 participants ; low‐quality evidence) and all‐cause mortality (RD ‐0.01, 95% CI ‐0.03 to 0.01; 24 studies, 5719 participants; low‐quality evidence). We graded the evidence to be of ‘moderate’ to ‘very low’ quality according to GRADE. All studies had a substantial risk of bias, because of lack of blinding of participants and personnel to the interventions, which is inherently impossible in a self‐management intervention. In addition, risk of bias was noticeably increased because of insufficient information regarding a) non‐protocol interventions, and b) analyses to estimate the effect of adhering to interventions. Consequently, the highest GRADE evidence score that could be obtained by studies was ‘moderate’. Authors' conclusions Self‐management interventions for people with COPD are associated with improvements in HRQoL, as measured with the SGRQ, and a lower probability of respiratory‐related hospital admissions. No excess respiratory‐related and all‐cause mortality risks were observed, which strengthens the view that COPD self‐management interventions are unlikely to cause harm. By using stricter inclusion criteria, we decreased heterogeneity in studies, but also reduced the number of included studies and therefore our capacity to conduct subgroup analyses. Data were therefore still insufficient to reach clear conclusions about effective (intervention) characteristics of COPD self‐management interventions. As tailoring of COPD self‐management interventions to individuals is desirable, heterogeneity is and will likely remain present in self‐management interventions. For future studies, we would urge using only COPD self‐management interventions that include iterative interactions between participants and healthcare professionals who are competent using behavioural change techniques (BCTs) to elicit participants' motivation, confidence and competence to positively adapt their health behaviour(s) and develop skills to better manage their disease. In addition, to inform further subgroup and meta‐regression analyses and to provide stronger conclusions regarding effective COPD self‐management interventions, there is a need for more homogeneity in outcome measures. More attention should be paid to behavioural outcome measures and to providing more detailed, uniform and transparently reported data on self‐management intervention components and BCTs. Assessment of outcomes over the long term is also recommended to capture changes in people's behaviour. Finally, information regarding non‐protocol interventions as well as analyses to estimate the effect of adhering to interventions should be included to increase the quality of evidence. Plain language summary Self‐management for people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease Review question  We looked at the current evidence on the effects of self‐management interventions for people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In particular, we assessed their effectiveness on health‐related quality of life (HRQoL) and hospital admissions related to COPD. We also wanted to assess whether self‐management interventions are safe by evaluating the number of deaths. Background  COPD is a common and long‐term lung condition that slowly worsens over the years, and causes symptoms such as breathlessness, coughing, wheezing and increased sputum (mucus) production. This leads to loss of well‐being (also known as reduction in HRQoL) in people with COPD. Self‐management interventions encourage people to develop the skills and behaviours they need to successfully manage their disease, and the emotional and practical issues that may go along with it. In this update, we reviewed the current evidence on the effects of self‐management on HRQoL, hospital admissions related to COPD, deaths from any cause and related to COPD, as well as other health outcomes. Search date  We searched for studies up until January 2020. Study characteristics  We included 27 studies, involving 6008 participants, that evaluated the effectiveness and safety of COPD self‐management interventions. The average age of the participants ranged between 57 and 74 years. Between 33% to 98% of the participants in the studies were male. Studies were conducted on four different continents (15 in Europe, eight in North America, one in Asia, and four in Oceania; with one study conducted in both Europe and Oceania). All studies had control groups of participants who received usual care – that is, care typical for people with COPD. The studies lasted between two‐and‐a‐half to 24 months. Key results  Self‐management interventions improved HRQoL in people with COPD compared to usual care, but this did not reach a clinically meaningful improvement. The number of participants with at least one hospital admission related to COPD was reduced amongst those who participated in a self‐management intervention. We found no difference in number of deaths between self‐management and usual care groups, which strengthens the view that COPD self‐management interventions are unlikely to cause harm. We have been strict about only including studies that met our definition of a COPD self‐management intervention. Despite this, the studies were still quite different from one another in terms of the intervention components used, duration of the self‐management intervention and the study populations. It should be noted, that heterogeneity in future interventions will be inevitable as individual tailoring of self‐management interventions is desirable; it will never be a 'one size fits all' intervention. Quality of the evidence  Our confidence in the evidence for the main findings in this review ranged from ‘very low’ to ‘moderate’, due to the nature of the COPD self‐management intervention – none of the studies prevented participants and personnel from knowing what treatment the participants were getting. Additionally, none of the studies provided detailed information about the extent to which participants adhere to the self‐management intervention or whether any further treatments were given during the course of the study. Consequently, study evidence could not be graded higher than ‘moderate’ in any of the studies.","1","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive [therapy]; *Self-Management; Aged; Hospitalization; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Outcome Assessment, Health Care; Quality of Life","10.1002/14651858.CD002990.pub4","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD002990.pub4","Airways"

This may lead to stress, burnout and psychosomatic problems, and deterioration of service provision. This is an update of a Cochrane Review that was last updated in 2015, which has been split into this review and a review on organisational‐level interventions.  Objectives To evaluate the effectiveness of stress‐reduction interventions targeting individual healthcare workers compared to no intervention, wait list, placebo, no stress‐reduction intervention or another type of stress‐reduction intervention in reducing stress symptoms.  Search methods We used the previous version of the review as one source of studies (search date: November 2013). We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Web of Science and a trials register from 2013 up to February 2022. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCT) evaluating the effectiveness of stress interventions directed at healthcare workers. We included only interventions targeted at individual healthcare workers aimed at reducing stress symptoms.  Data collection and analysis Review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We categorised interventions into ones that: 1. focus one’s attention  on  the (modification of the) experience of stress (thoughts, feelings, behaviour);  2. focus one’s attention  away  from the experience of stress by various means of psychological disengagement (e.g. relaxing, exercise);  3. alter work‐related risk factors on an individual level; and ones that 4. combine two or more of the above.  The crucial outcome measure was stress symptoms measured with various self‐reported questionnaires such as the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI), measured at short term (up to and including three months after the intervention ended), medium term (> 3 to 12 months after the intervention ended), and long term follow‐up (> 12 months after the intervention ended).  Main results This is the second update of the original Cochrane Review published in 2006, Issue 4. This review update includes 89 new studies, bringing the total number of studies in the current review to 117 with a total of 11,119 participants randomised.  The number of participants per study arm was ≥ 50 in 32 studies. The most important risk of bias was the lack of blinding of participants.  Focus on the experience of stress versus no intervention/wait list/placebo/no stress‐reduction intervention Fifty‐two studies studied an intervention in which one's focus is on the experience of stress. Overall, such interventions may result in a reduction in stress symptoms in the short term (standardised mean difference (SMD) ‐0.37, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐0.52 to ‐0.23; 41 RCTs; 3645 participants; low‐certainty evidence) and medium term (SMD ‐0.43, 95% CI ‐0.71 to ‐0.14; 19 RCTs; 1851 participants; low‐certainty evidence). The SMD of the short‐term result translates back to 4.6 points fewer on the MBI‐emotional exhaustion scale (MBI‐EE, a scale from 0 to 54). The evidence is very uncertain (one RCT; 68 participants, very low‐certainty evidence) about the long‐term effect on stress symptoms of focusing one's attention on the experience of stress. Focus away from the experience of stress versus no intervention/wait list/placebo/no stress‐reduction intervention  Forty‐two studies studied an intervention in which one's focus is away from the experience of stress. Overall, such interventions may result in a reduction in stress symptoms in the short term (SMD ‐0.55, 95 CI ‐0.70 to ‐0.40; 35 RCTs; 2366 participants; low‐certainty evidence) and medium term (SMD ‐0.41 95% CI ‐0.79 to ‐0.03; 6 RCTs; 427 participants; low‐certainty evidence). The SMD on the short term translates back to 6.8 fewer points on the MBI‐EE. No studies reported the long‐term effect. Focus on work‐related, individual‐level factors versus no intervention/no stress‐reduction intervention Seven studies studied an intervention in which the focus is on altering work‐related factors. The evidence is very uncertain about the short‐term effects (no pooled effect estimate; three RCTs; 87 participants; very low‐certainty evidence) and medium‐term effects and long‐term effects (no pooled effect estimate; two RCTs; 152 participants, and one RCT; 161 participants, very low‐certainty evidence) of this type of stress management intervention.  A combination of individual‐level interventions versus no intervention/wait list/no stress‐reduction intervention Seventeen studies studied a combination of interventions. In the short‐term, this type of intervention may result in a reduction in stress symptoms (SMD ‐0.67 95%, CI ‐0.95 to ‐0.39; 15 RCTs; 1003 participants; low‐certainty evidence). The SMD translates back to 8.2 fewer points on the MBI‐EE. On the medium term, a combination of individual‐level interventions may result in a reduction in stress symptoms, but the evidence does not exclude no effect (SMD ‐0.48, 95% CI ‐0.95 to 0.00; 6 RCTs; 574 participants; low‐certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain about the long term effects of a combination of interventions on stress symptoms (one RCT, 88 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). Focus on stress versus other intervention type  Three studies compared focusing on stress versus focusing away from stress and one study a combination of interventions versus focusing on stress. The evidence is very uncertain about which type of intervention is better or if their effect is similar. Authors' conclusions Our review shows that there may be an effect on stress reduction in healthcare workers from individual‐level stress interventions, whether they focus one's attention on or away from the experience of stress. This effect may last up to a year after the end of the intervention. A combination of interventions may be beneficial as well, at least in the short term. Long‐term effects of individual‐level stress management interventions remain unknown. The same applies for interventions on (individual‐level) work‐related risk factors. The bias assessment of the studies in this review showed the need for methodologically better‐designed and executed studies, as nearly all studies suffered from poor reporting of the randomisation procedures, lack of blinding of participants and lack of trial registration. Better‐designed trials with larger sample sizes are required to increase the certainty of the evidence. Last, there is a need for more studies on interventions which focus on work‐related risk factors.  Plain language summary The effect of individual‐level interventions for reducing stress in healthcare workers Key messages ‐ Individual‐level interventions in which one’s attention is  on  the experience of stress (like focusing on thoughts, feelings, behaviour) or  away  from the experience of stress (like exercising, relaxing) may reduce stress among healthcare workers up to one year after the intervention. ‐ A combination of individual‐level interventions may reduce stress up to a couple of months after the intervention.  ‐ We do not know if interventions that focus on work‐related risk factors on an individual level have any effect on stress. What is stress? There is currently no clear definition of (work‐related) stress. This review is about healthcare workers with low levels of stress to moderate distress and burnout, which might lead to depression and anxiety but does not have to. People with stress can experience physical symptoms like headaches, muscle tension or pain, but also mental symptoms, like impaired concentration. They can also have behavioural problems (like conflicts with other people) and emotional problems (like emotional instability). What can be done about stress among healthcare workers? Stress among healthcare workers can be tackled at an organisational level, but also at an individual level. Stress management interventions at the individual‐level aim to: ‐ focus one’s attention  on  the experience of stress (thoughts, feelings, behaviour), for example by cognitive‐behavioural therapy or coping skills training; ‐ focus one’s attention  away  from the experience of stress, for example by yoga, Tai Chi, drawing, or acupuncture;  ‐ alter work‐related risk factors on an individual level, such as alterations in work demands. What did we want to find out? We wanted to find out if various types of individual‐level stress management interventions are better than no intervention (or another intervention) to reduce stress among healthcare workers currently working as such. What did we do We searched for studies that looked at stress management interventions in healthcare workers and reported on stress symptoms. The healthcare workforce comprises a wide variety of professions and occupations who provide some type of healthcare service, including direct care practitioners and allied professionals.  We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and study size. What did we find? We found a total of 117 studies that involved a total of 11,119 healthcare workers. Most studies followed their participants up to three months and some up to 12 months, but only few longer than a year.  We found that there may be an effect on stress reduction in healthcare workers from stress management interventions, whether they focus one's attention on or away from the experience of stress. This effect may last up to a year after the end of the intervention. A combination of interventions may be beneficial as well, at least in the short term. The long‐term effects of stress management interventions, longer than a year after the intervention has ended, remain unknown. The same applies for interventions on (individual‐level) work‐related risk factors. What are the limitations of the evidence? The estimates of the effects of individual‐level stress management interventions may be biassed because of a lack of blinding of the participants in the included studies. Furthermore, many studies were relatively small. Taken together, our confidence in the effects we found is reduced.   How up to date is this evidence? The evidence is up‐to‐date to February 2022.","5","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Health Personnel [psychology]; *Occupational Stress [prevention & control]; Anxiety [diagnosis]; Emotions; Humans; Psychotherapy [methods]","10.1002/14651858.CD002892.pub6","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD002892.pub6","Work"

People with bipolar disorder report lower levels of physical activity than the general population, and are at greater risk of chronic health conditions including cardiovascular disease and obesity. These contribute to poor health outcomes. Physical activity has the potential to improve quality of life and physical and mental well‐being. Objectives To identify the factors that influence participation in physical activity for people diagnosed with bipolar disorder from the perspectives of service users, carers, service providers, and practitioners to help inform the design and implementation of interventions that promote physical activity. Search methods We searched MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and eight other databases to March 2021. We also contacted experts in the field, searched the grey literature, and carried out reference checking and citation searching to identify additional studies. There were no language restrictions. Selection criteria We included qualitative studies and mixed‐methods studies with an identifiable qualitative component. We included studies that focused on the experiences and attitudes of service users, carers, service providers, and healthcare professionals towards physical activity for bipolar disorder. Data collection and analysis We extracted data using a data extraction form designed for this review. We assessed methodological limitations using a list of predefined questions. We used the ""best fit"" framework synthesis based on a revised version of the Health Belief Model to analyse and present the evidence. We assessed methodological limitations using the CASP Qualitative Checklist. We used the GRADE‐CERQual (Confidence in the Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative research) guidance to assess our confidence in each finding. We examined each finding to identify factors to inform the practice of health and care professionals and the design and development of physical activity interventions for people with bipolar disorder. Main results We included 12 studies involving a total of 592 participants (422 participants who contributed qualitative data to an online survey, 170 participants in qualitative research studies). Most studies explored the views and experiences of physical activity of people with experience of bipolar disorder. A number of studies also reported on personal experiences of physical activity components of lifestyle interventions. One study included views from family carers and clinicians. The majority of studies were from high‐income countries, with only one study conducted in a middle‐income country. Most participants were described as stable and had been living with a diagnosis of bipolar disorder for a number of years. We downgraded our confidence in several of the findings from high confidence to moderate or low confidence, as some findings were based on only small amounts of data, and the findings were based on studies from only a few countries, questioning the relevance of these findings to other settings. We also had very few perspectives of family members, other carers, or health professionals supporting people with bipolar disorder. The studies did not include any findings from service providers about their perspectives on supporting this aspect of care. There were a number of factors that limited people's ability to undertake physical activity. Shame and stigma about one's physical appearance and mental health diagnosis were discussed. Some people felt their sporting skills/competencies had been lost when they left school. Those who had been able to maintain exercise through the transition into adulthood appeared to be more likely to include physical activity in their regular routine. Physical health limits and comorbid health conditions limited activity. This included bipolar medication, being overweight, smoking, alcohol use, poor diet and sleep, and these barriers were linked to negative coping skills. Practical problems included affordability, accessibility, transport links, and the weather. Workplace or health schemes that offered discounts were viewed positively. The lack of opportunity for exercise within inpatient mental health settings was a problem. Facilitating factors included being psychologically stable and ready to adopt new lifestyle behaviours. There were positive benefits of being active outdoors and connecting with nature. Achieving balance, rhythm, and routine helped to support mood management. Fitting physical activity into a regular routine despite fluctuating mood or motivation appeared to be beneficial if practised at the right intensity and pace. Over‐ or under‐exercising could be counterproductive and accelerate depressive or manic moods. Physical activity also helped to provide a structure to people's daily routines and could lead to other positive lifestyle benefits. Monitoring physical or other activities could be an effective way to identify potential triggers or early warning signs. Technology was helpful for some. People who had researched bipolar disorder and had developed a better understanding of the condition showed greater confidence in managing their care or providing care to others. Social support from friends/family or health professionals was an enabling factor, as was finding the right type of exercise, which for many people was walking. Other benefits included making social connections, weight loss, improved quality of life, and better mood regulation. Few people had been told of the benefits of physical activity. Better education and training of health professionals could support a more holistic approach to physical and mental well‐being. Involving mental health professionals in the multidisciplinary delivery of physical activity interventions could be beneficial and improve care. Clear guidelines could help people to initiate and incorporate lifestyle changes. Authors' conclusions There is very little research focusing on factors that influence participation in physical activity in bipolar disorder. The studies we identified suggest that men and women with bipolar disorder face a range of obstacles and challenges to being active. The evidence also suggests that there are effective ways to promote managed physical activity. The research highlighted the important role that health and care settings, and professionals, can play in assessing individuals' physical health needs and how healthy lifestyles may be promoted. Based on these findings, we have provided a summary of key elements to consider for developing physical activity interventions for bipolar disorder. Plain language summary Factors that influence physical activity in bipolar disorder Key messages We found few studies that explored factors that influence participation in physical activity for people with bipolar disorder. The studies we found suggested that regular physical activity can be beneficial for people with bipolar disorder, but there are some obstacles and challenges to as well as effective ways of promoting being active. What was the aim of this synthesis? The aim of this qualitative evidence synthesis was to explore the factors that promote physical activity for people with bipolar disorder. We searched for and analysed qualitative studies of views and experiences of people with bipolar disorder, health professionals, and family/carer perspectives. We included 12 studies involving a total of 592 participants (422 participants who contributed qualitative data to an online survey, 170 from qualitative studies). What was studied in this synthesis? Many people with bipolar disorder have physical health problems, and increasing physical activity may help improve their physical and mental well‐being. We studied qualitative research (research that gathers participants' experiences, beliefs, and behaviour) that aimed to promote physical activity for bipolar disorder and sought views from service users, health professionals, and family/carers. The review authors, who are researchers and/or health professionals working in the area of mental health and physical activity, identified this review topic because of limited research published in the area. What are the main findings of this synthesis? We included 12 studies conducted in Europe, North and South America, and Australia. Eleven studies were based in high‐income countries (Australia, Belgium, Canada, Spain, the UK, and the USA), and one was from a middle‐income country (Brazil). Most studies explored the views and experiences of physical activity in people with bipolar disorder. There were more women than men in the included research, and participants were described as stable with regard to their disease and interested in making lifestyle changes to improve their health. We downgraded our confidence from high to moderate or low confidence because some findings were based on small amounts of data or on studies from only a few countries, questioning how applicable these findings are to other settings. There were also very few perspectives from family members, other carers, or health professionals. There were no findings from service providers. In general, people had limited knowledge of the benefits of physical activity for managing mental health symptoms and of their physical health needs. Many people experienced shame and stigma about their physical and mental health, which contributed to anxiety and embarrassment and negative ways of coping, such as socially isolating. Taking medication, being overweight, smoking, and sleep were challenges to being more active. Lack of time and money, bad weather, poor transport, and personal safety concerns were also highlighted as problems. Tackling the sharp reduction in activity levels when young people leave education is a significant public health issue, particularly for young women. Workplace or healthcare schemes were considered beneficial. Being psychologically ready to be active and having social support and encouragement was helpful. People enjoyed connecting with nature and making social connections, and reported other benefits including weight loss, improved quality of life, and better mood regulation. Finding an enjoyable physical activity and incorporating it into a regular routine at the right level and intensity contributed to mood management and improved well‐being. Offering safe, accessible, inclusive, and low‐cost opportunities to be active could help reduce stigma and promote physical activity and social connections. Clearer guidelines about the benefits of physical activity should inform health and care treatment plans, and involving teams across fields of speciality with knowledge and experience in bipolar disorder could help support people to increase physical activity levels. Adjustments and support may need to be made to establish a beneficial activity programme and balanced routine. Interventions that take a phased, step‐by‐step approach to introduce lifestyle changes, for example increasing physical activity, healthy eating, and reducing risk behaviours (e.g. stopping smoking), are practical and effective. More research is required to establish the views and experiences of family members and carers and health and care professionals, as well as people who do not feel ready to engage in physical activity.

The factors contributing to this increase are complex, and identifying interventions to address them is challenging. Non‐clinical interventions are applied independently of a clinical encounter between a health provider and a patient. Such interventions may target women, health professionals or organisations. They address the determinants of caesarean births and could have a role in reducing unnecessary caesarean sections. This review was first published in 2011. This review update will inform a new WHO guideline, and the scope of the update was informed by WHO’s Guideline Development Group for this guideline. Objectives To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of non‐clinical interventions intended to reduce unnecessary caesarean section. Search methods We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and two trials registers in March 2018. We also searched websites of relevant organisations and reference lists of related reviews. Selection criteria Randomised trials, non‐randomised trials, controlled before‐after studies, interrupted time series studies and repeated measures studies were eligible for inclusion. The primary outcome measures were: caesarean section, spontaneous vaginal birth and instrumental birth. Data collection and analysis We followed standard methodological procedures recommended by Cochrane. We narratively described results of individual studies (drawing summarised evidence from single studies assessing distinct interventions). Main results We included 29 studies in this review (19 randomised trials, 1 controlled before‐after study and 9 interrupted time series studies). Most of the studies (20 studies) were conducted in high‐income countries and none took place in low‐income countries. The studies enrolled a mixed population of pregnant women, including nulliparous women, multiparous women, women with a fear of childbirth, women with high levels of anxiety and women having undergone a previous caesarean section. Overall, we found low‐, moderate‐ or high‐certainty evidence that the following interventions have a beneficial effect on at least one primary outcome measure and no moderate‐ or high‐certainty evidence of adverse effects. Interventions targeted at women or families Childbirth training workshops for mothers alone may reduce caesarean section (risk ratio (RR) 0.55, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.33 to 0.89) and may increase spontaneous vaginal birth (RR 2.25, 95% CI 1.16 to 4.36). Childbirth training workshops for couples may reduce caesarean section (RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.94) and may increase spontaneous vaginal birth (RR 2.13, 95% CI 1.09 to 4.16). We judged this one study with 60 participants to have low‐certainty evidence for the outcomes above. Nurse‐led applied relaxation training programmes (RR 0.22, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.43; 104 participants, low‐certainty evidence) and psychosocial couple‐based prevention programmes (RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.90; 147 participants, low‐certainty evidence) may reduce caesarean section. Psychoeducation may increase spontaneous vaginal birth (RR 1.33, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.61; 371 participants, low‐certainty evidence). The control group received routine maternity care in all studies. There were insufficient data on the effect of the four interventions on maternal and neonatal mortality or morbidity. Interventions targeted at healthcare professionals Implementation of clinical practice guidelines combined with mandatory second opinion for caesarean section indication slightly reduces the risk of overall caesarean section (mean difference in rate change ‐1.9%, 95% CI ‐3.8 to ‐0.1; 149,223 participants). Implementation of clinical practice guidelines combined with audit and feedback also slightly reduces the risk of caesarean section (risk difference (RD) ‐1.8%, 95% CI ‐3.8 to ‐0.2; 105,351 participants). Physician education by local opinion leader (obstetrician‐gynaecologist) reduced the risk of elective caesarean section to 53.7% from 66.8% (opinion leader education: 53.7%, 95% CI 46.5 to 61.0%; control: 66.8%, 95% CI 61.7 to 72.0%; 2496 participants). Healthcare professionals in the control groups received routine care in the studies. There was little or no difference in maternal and neonatal mortality or morbidity between study groups. We judged the certainty of evidence to be high. Interventions targeted at healthcare organisations or facilities Collaborative midwifery‐labourist care (in which the obstetrician provides in‐house labour and delivery coverage, 24 hours a day, without competing clinical duties), versus a private practice model of care, may reduce the primary caesarean section rate. In one interrupted time series study, the caesarean section rate decreased by 7% in the year after the intervention, and by 1.7% per year thereafter (1722 participants); the vaginal birth rate after caesarean section increased from 13.3% before to 22.4% after the intervention (684 participants). Maternal and neonatal mortality were not reported. We judged the certainty of evidence to be low. We studied the following interventions, and they either made little or no difference to caesarean section rates or had uncertain effects. Moderate‐certainty evidence suggests little or no difference in caesarean section rates between usual care and: antenatal education programmes for physiologic childbirth; antenatal education on natural childbirth preparation with training in breathing and relaxation techniques; computer‐based decision aids; individualised prenatal education and support programmes (versus written information in pamphlet). Low‐certainty evidence suggests little or no difference in caesarean section rates between usual care and: psychoeducation; pelvic floor muscle training exercises with telephone follow‐up (versus pelvic floor muscle training without telephone follow‐up); intensive group therapy (cognitive behavioural therapy and childbirth psychotherapy); education of public health nurses on childbirth classes; role play (versus standard education using lectures); interactive decision aids (versus educational brochures); labourist model of obstetric care (versus traditional model of obstetric care). We are very uncertain as to the effect of other interventions identified on caesarean section rates as the certainty of the evidence is very low. Authors' conclusions We evaluated a wide range of non‐clinical interventions to reduce unnecessary caesarean section, mostly in high‐income settings. Few interventions with moderate‐ or high‐certainty evidence, mainly targeting healthcare professionals (implementation of guidelines combined with mandatory second opinion, implementation of guidelines combined with audit and feedback, physician education by local opinion leader) have been shown to safely reduce caesarean section rates. There are uncertainties in existing evidence related to very‐low or low‐certainty evidence, applicability of interventions and lack of studies, particularly around interventions targeted at women or families and healthcare organisations or facilities. Plain language summary Non‐clinical interventions for reducing unnecessary caesarean section What is the aim of this review? The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out whether non‐clinical interventions, which aim to reduce unnecessary caesarean sections, such as providing education to healthcare workers and mothers, are safe and effective. This review was first published in 2011. This review update will inform a new WHO guideline, and the scope of the update was informed by WHO’s Guideline Development Group for this guideline. Key messages We studied a wide range of non‐clinical interventions that aim to reduce unnecessary caesarean sections, mostly in high‐income countries. Based on high‐quality evidence, few interventions have been shown to reduce caesarean section rates without adverse effects on maternal or neonatal outcomes. These interventions are mainly aimed at healthcare professionals (nurses, midwives, physicians) and involve using: clinical guidelines combined with mandatory second opinion for caesarean section indication; clinical guidelines combined with audit and feedback about caesarean section practices; and opinion leaders (obstetrician/gynaecologist) to provide education to healthcare professionals. What was studied in this review? Caesarean section is an operation used to prevent and reduce complications of childbirth. While it can be a life‐saving procedure for both the mother and baby, caesarean section is not without harm and should only be carried out when necessary. Caesarean sections increase the likelihood of bleeding, maternal infections and infant breathing problems, among other complications. The number of caesarean sections performed has been increasing worldwide. Whilst there may be medical reasons for this increase, other factors, such as clinician convenience and maternal fears, may also be responsible. What are the main results of the review? We included 29 studies in this review. Most of the studies (20 studies) were conducted in high‐income countries; none in low‐income countries. We rated the quality of the evidence from studies using four levels: very low, low, moderate, or high. Very low‐quality means that we are very uncertain about the results. High‐quality evidence means that we are very confident in the results. Overall, we found eight of the 29 interventions included in the review to have a beneficial effect on at least one of our main outcomes with low‐, moderate‐ or high‐quality evidence, and no moderate‐ or high‐quality evidence of harm: Interventions aimed at women or families : providing childbirth training workshops for mothers and couples; relaxation training programmes led by nurses; psychosocial couple‐based prevention programmes; and psychoeducation. The interventions were compared to routine practice. The quality of evidence from the studies was low. Interventions aimed at healthcare professionals:  using clinical guidelines combined with mandatory second opinion for caesarean section indication; using clinical guidelines combined with audit and feedback about caesarean section practices; and having opinion leaders (obstetrician/gynaecologist) provide education to healthcare professionals. The interventions were compared to routine practice. The quality of evidence was high. Interventions aimed at healthcare organisations or facilities : collaborative midwifery‐labourist model of care (in which the obstetrician provides in‐house labour and delivery coverage, 24 hours a day, without competing clinical duties) compared to a private model of care. The quality of evidence was low. We studied a number of other interventions and they either made little or no difference to caesarean section rates, or had uncertain effects. Limited data were available on possible harms associated with the interventions examined in this review. How up‐to‐date is this review?

Such programs are usually offered to groups but may be offered to individuals. Objectives To assess the effects of this education on knowledge acquisition, anxiety, sense of control, pain, labour and birth support, breastfeeding, infant‐care abilities, and psychological and social adjustment. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (April 2006), CINAHL (1982 to April 2006), ERIC (1984 to April 2006), EMBASE (1980 to April 2006) and PsycINFO (1988 to April 2006). We handsearched the Journal of Psychosomatic Research from 1956 to April 2006 and reviewed the reference lists of retrieved studies. We updated the search of the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register on 7 July 2011 and added the results to the awaiting classification section of the review. Selection criteria Randomized controlled trials of any structured educational program provided during pregnancy by an educator to either parent that included information related to pregnancy, birth or parenthood. The educational interventions could have been provided on an individual or group basis. Educational interventions directed exclusively to either increasing breastfeeding success, knowledge of and coping skills concerning postpartum depression, improving maternal psycho‐social health including anxiety, depression and self‐esteem or reducing smoking were excluded. Data collection and analysis Both authors assessed trial quality and extracted data from published reports. Main results Nine trials, involving 2284 women, were included. Thirty‐seven studies were excluded. Educational interventions were the focus of eight of the studies (combined n = 1009). Details of the randomization procedure, allocation concealment, and/or participant accrual or loss for these trials were not reported. No consistent results were found. Sample sizes were very small to moderate, ranging from 10 to 318. No data were reported concerning anxiety, breastfeeding success, or general social support. Knowledge acquisition, sense of control, factors related to infant‐care competencies, and some labour and birth outcomes were measured. The largest of the included studies (n = 1275) examined an educational and social support intervention to increase vaginal birth after caesarean section. This high‐quality study showed similar rates of vaginal birth after caesarean section in 'verbal' and 'document' groups (relative risk 1.08, 95% confidence interval 0.97 to 1.21). Authors' conclusions The effects of general antenatal education for childbirth or parenthood, or both, remain largely unknown. Individualized prenatal education directed toward avoidance of a repeat caesarean birth does not increase the rate of vaginal birth after caesarean section. [Note: the 58 citations in the awaiting classification section may alter the conclusions of the review once assessed.] Plain language summary Individual or group antenatal education for childbirth or parenthood, or both Benefits of antenatal education for childbirth, and the best educational approaches to use, remain unclear. Antenatal education aims to help prospective parents prepare for childbirth and parenthood. Prospective parents often look to antenatal education to provide important information on issues such as decision making about and during labour, skills for labour, pain relief, infant and postnatal care, breastfeeding and parenting skills. There are many varied ways of providing this antenatal education and some may be more effective than others. The review found nine trials involving 2284 women. Interventions varied greatly and no consistent outcomes were measured. The review of trials found a lack of high‐quality evidence from trials and so the effects of antenatal education remain largely unknown. Further research is required to ensure that effective ways of helping health professionals support pregnant women and their partners in preparing for birth and parenting are investigated so that the resources used meet the needs of parents and their newborn infants.","3","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Labor, Obstetric; *Parenting; Fathers [education]; Female; Humans; Mothers [education]; Pregnancy; Prenatal Care [methods]; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Vaginal Birth after Cesarean","10.1002/14651858.CD002869.pub2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD002869.pub2","Pregnancy and Childbirth"

Owing to the fact that many tasks do not necessarily require the knowledge and skills of a doctor, interest in using nurses to expand the capacity of the primary care workforce is increasing. Substitution of nurses for doctors is one strategy used to improve access, efficiency, and quality of care. This is the first update of the Cochrane review published in 2005. Objectives Our aim was to investigate the impact of nurses working as  substitutes  for primary care doctors on: • patient outcomes; • processes of care; and • utilisation, including volume and cost. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), part of the Cochrane Library ( www.cochranelibrary.com ), as well as MEDLINE, Ovid, and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) and EbscoHost (searched 20.01.2015). We searched for grey literature in the Grey Literature Report and OpenGrey (21.02.2017), and we searched the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov trial registries (21.02.2017). We did a cited reference search for relevant studies (searched 27.01 2015) and checked reference lists of all included studies. We reran slightly revised strategies, limited to publication years between 2015 and 2017, for CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and CINAHL, in March 2017, and we have added one trial to ‘Studies awaiting classification’. Selection criteria Randomised trials evaluating the outcomes of nurses working as substitutes for doctors. The review is limited to primary healthcare services that provide first contact and ongoing care for patients with all types of health problems, excluding mental health problems. Studies which evaluated nurses supplementing the work of primary care doctors were excluded. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently carried out data extraction and assessment of risk of bias of included studies. When feasible, we combined study results and determined an overall estimate of the effect. We evaluated other outcomes by completing a structured synthesis. Main results For this review, we identified 18 randomised trials evaluating the impact of nurses working as substitutes for doctors. One study was conducted in a middle‐income country, and all other studies in high‐income countries. The nursing level was often unclear or varied between and even within studies. The studies looked at nurses involved in first contact care (including urgent care), ongoing care for physical complaints, and follow‐up of patients with a particular chronic conditions such as diabetes. In many of the studies, nurses could get additional support or advice from a doctor. Nurse‐doctor substitution for preventive services and health education in primary care has been less well studied. Study findings suggest that care delivered by nurses, compared to care delivered by doctors, probably generates similar or better health outcomes for a broad range of patient conditions (low‐ or moderate‐certainty evidence): • Nurse‐led primary care may lead to slightly fewer deaths among certain groups of patients, compared to doctor‐led care. However, the results vary and it is possible that nurse‐led primary care makes little or no difference to the number of deaths (low‐certainty evidence). • Blood pressure outcomes are probably slightly improved in nurse‐led primary care. Other clinical or health status outcomes are probably similar (moderate‐certainty evidence). • Patient satisfaction is probably slightly higher in nurse‐led primary care (moderate‐certainty evidence). Quality of life may be slightly higher (low‐certainty evidence). We are uncertain of the effects of nurse‐led care on process of care because the certainty of this evidence was assessed as very low. The effect of nurse‐led care on utilisation of care is mixed and depends on the type of outcome. Consultations are probably longer in nurse‐led primary care (moderate‐certainty evidence), and numbers of attended return visits are slightly higher for nurses than for doctors (high‐certainty evidence). We found little or no difference between nurses and doctors in the number of prescriptions and attendance at accident and emergency units (high‐certainty evidence). There may be little or no difference in the number of tests and investigations, hospital referrals and hospital admissions between nurses and doctors (low‐certainty evidence). We are uncertain of the effects of nurse‐led care on the costs of care because the certainty of this evidence was assessed as very low. Authors' conclusions This review shows that for some ongoing and urgent physical complaints and for chronic conditions, trained nurses, such as nurse practitioners, practice nurses, and registered nurses, probably provide equal or possibly even better quality of care compared to primary care doctors, and probably achieve equal or better health outcomes for patients. Nurses probably achieve higher levels of patient satisfaction, compared to primary care doctors. Furthermore, consultation length is probably longer when nurses deliver care and the frequency of attended return visits is probably slightly higher for nurses, compared to doctors. Other utilisation outcomes are probably the same. The effects of nurse‐led care on process of care and the costs of care are uncertain, and we also cannot ascertain what level of nursing education leads to the best outcomes when nurses are substituted for doctors. Plain language summary Nurses as substitutes for doctors in primary care What is the aim of this review? The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out what happens when primary healthcare services are delivered by nurses instead of doctors. We collected and analysed all relevant studies to answer this question and found 18 studies for inclusion in the review. What are the key messages of this review? Delivery of primary healthcare services by nurses instead of doctors probably leads to similar or better patient health and higher patient satisfaction. Nurses probably also have longer consultations with patients. Using nurses instead of doctors makes little or no difference in the numbers of prescriptions and tests ordered. However, the impacts on the amount of information offered to patients, on the extent to which guidelines are followed and on healthcare costs are uncertain. What was studied in this review? In most countries, the population is growing older and more people have chronic disease. This means that the services that primary healthcare workers need to deliver are changing. At the same time, many countries lack doctors and other healthcare workers, or people struggle to pay for healthcare services. By using nurses instead of doctors, countries hope to deliver care of the same quality for less money. In this review, we searched for studies that compared nurses to doctors for delivery of primary care services. We looked at whether this made any difference in patients’ health, satisfaction, and use of services. We also looked at whether this made any difference in how services were delivered and in how much they cost. What are the main results of this review? We included in this review 18 studies, mainly from high‐income countries. In some studies, nurses were responsible for all patients who came to the clinic or for all patients who needed urgent consultation. In some studies, nurses were responsible for patients with particular chronic diseases, or were responsible for providing healthcare education or preventive services to certain groups of patients. Included studies compared these nurses to doctors carrying out the same tasks. Our review shows that nurse‐led primary care may lead to slightly fewer deaths among certain groups of patients, compared to doctor‐led care. However, the results vary and it is possible that nurse‐led primary care makes little or no difference to the number of deaths. In addition, patients probably have similar or better results in areas of health such as heart disease, diabetes, rheumatism, and high blood pressure. Patients also are probably slightly more satisfied with their care and may have a slightly better quality of life when treated by nurses. This review also shows that, compared to doctors, nurses probably have longer consultations, and their patients are slightly more likely to keep follow‐up appointments. Studies found little or no difference in the number of prescriptions and there may be little or no difference in the numbers of tests and investigations ordered, or in patients’ use of other services. The effects of nurse‐led primary care on the amount of advice and information given to patients, and on whether guidelines are followed, are uncertain as the certainty of these findings is very low. Our review suggests that the impacts on the costs of care of using nurses instead of doctors to deliver primary care are uncertain. We assessed the certainty of this finding as very low.

Effective oral hygiene involves removing dental plaque, for example, by regular toothbrushing. People with intellectual disabilities (ID) can have poor oral hygiene and oral health outcomes. Objectives To assess the effects (benefits and harms) of oral hygiene interventions, specifically the mechanical removal of plaque, for people with intellectual disabilities (ID). Search methods Cochrane Oral Health's Information Specialist searched the following databases to 4 February 2019: Cochrane Oral Health's Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; Cochrane Register of Studies), MEDLINE Ovid, Embase Ovid and PsycINFO Ovid. ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform were searched for ongoing trials. The Embase search was restricted by date due to the Cochrane Centralised Search Project, which makes available clinical trials indexed in Embase through CENTRAL. We handsearched specialist conference abstracts from the International Association of Disability and Oral Health (2006 to 2016). Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and some types of non‐randomised studies (NRS) (non‐RCTs, controlled before‐after studies, interrupted time series studies and repeated measures studies) that evaluated oral hygiene interventions targeted at people with ID or their carers, or both. We used the definition of ID in the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th revision (ICD‐10). We defined oral hygiene as the mechanical removal of plaque. We excluded studies that evaluated chemical removal of plaque, or mechanical and chemical removal of plaque combined. Data collection and analysis At least two review authors independently screened search records, identified relevant studies, extracted data, assessed risk of bias and judged the certainty of the evidence according to GRADE criteria. We contacted study authors for additional information if required. We reported RCTs and NRSs separately. Main results We included 19 RCTs and 15 NRSs involving 1795 adults and children with ID and 354 carers. Interventions evaluated were: special manual toothbrushes, electric toothbrushes, oral hygiene training, scheduled dental visits plus supervised toothbrushing, discussion of clinical photographs showing plaque, varied frequency of toothbrushing, plaque‐disclosing agents and individualised care plans. We categorised results as short (six weeks or less), medium (between six weeks and 12 months) and long term (more than 12 months). Most studies were small; all were at overall high or unclear risk of bias. None of the studies reported quality of life or dental caries. We present below the evidence available from RCTs (or NRS if the comparison had no RCTs) for gingival health (inflammation and plaque) and adverse effects, as well as knowledge and behaviour outcomes for the training studies. Very low‐certainty evidence suggested a special manual toothbrush (the Superbrush) reduced gingival inflammation (GI), and possibly plaque, more than a conventional toothbrush in the medium term (GI: mean difference (MD) –12.40, 95% CI –24.31 to –0.49; plaque: MD –0.44, 95% CI –0.93 to 0.05; 1 RCT, 18 participants); brushing was carried out by the carers. In the short term, neither toothbrush showed superiority (GI: MD –0.10, 95% CI –0.77 to 0.57; plaque: MD 0.20, 95% CI –0.45 to 0.85; 1 RCT, 25 participants; low‐ to very low‐certainty evidence). Moderate‐ and low‐certainty evidence found no difference between electric and manual toothbrushes for reducing GI or plaque, respectively, in the medium term (GI: MD 0.02, 95% CI –0.06 to 0.09; plaque: standardised mean difference 0.29, 95% CI –0.07 to 0.65; 2 RCTs, 120 participants). Short‐term findings were inconsistent (4 RCTs; low‐ to very low‐certainty evidence). Low‐certainty evidence suggested training carers in oral hygiene care had no detectable effect on levels of GI or plaque in the medium term (GI: MD –0.09, 95% CI –0.63 to 0.45; plaque: MD –0.07, 95% CI –0.26 to 0.13; 2 RCTs, 99 participants). Low‐certainty evidence suggested oral hygiene knowledge of carers was better in the medium term after training (MD 0.69, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.06; 2 RCTs, 189 participants); this was not found in the short term, and results for changes in behaviour, attitude and self‐efficacy were mixed. One RCT (10 participants) found that training people with ID in oral hygiene care reduced plaque but not GI in the short term (GI: MD –0.28, 95% CI –0.90 to 0.34; plaque: MD –0.47, 95% CI –0.92 to –0.02; very low‐certainty evidence). One RCT (304 participants) found that scheduled dental recall visits (at 1‐, 3‐ or 6‐month intervals) plus supervised daily toothbrushing were more likely than usual care to reduce GI (pocketing but not bleeding) and plaque in the long term (low‐certainty evidence). One RCT (29 participants) found that motivating people with ID about oral hygiene by discussing photographs of their teeth with plaque highlighted by a plaque‐disclosing agent, did not reduce plaque in the medium term (very low‐certainty evidence). One RCT (80 participants) found daily toothbrushing by dental students was more effective for reducing plaque in people with ID than once‐ or twice‐weekly toothbrushing in the short term (low‐certainty evidence). A benefit to gingival health was found by one NRS that evaluated toothpaste with a plaque‐disclosing agent and one that evaluated individualised oral care plans (very low‐certainty evidence). Most studies did not report adverse effects; of those that did, only one study considered them as a formal outcome. Some studies reported participant difficulties using the electric or special manual toothbrushes. Authors' conclusions Although some oral hygiene interventions for people with ID show benefits, the clinical importance of these benefits is unclear. The evidence is mainly low or very low certainty. Moderate‐certainty evidence was available for only one finding: electric and manual toothbrushes were similarly effective for reducing gingival inflammation in people with ID in the medium term. Larger, higher‐quality RCTs are recommended to endorse or refute the findings of this review. In the meantime, oral hygiene care and advice should be based on professional expertise and the needs and preferences of the individual with ID and their carers. Plain language summary Oral hygiene programmes for people with intellectual disabilities Review question How effective are oral hygiene programmes for people with intellectual disabilities? Background The removal of dental plaque by daily toothbrushing plays a major role in preventing tooth decay and gum disease, the two main causes of tooth loss. Toothbrushing is a skill that can be difficult for people with ID; they may require help and people who care for them may need training in how to help them. Study characteristics We searched for studies up to 4 February 2019. This review included 34 studies that involved 1795 people with ID and 354 carers. Nineteen studies randomly allocated participants to two or more groups (i.e. randomised controlled trials (RCTs), and 15 were non‐randomised studies (NRS). The studies assessed different ways to improve the oral hygiene of people with ID: special manual toothbrushes; electric toothbrushes; oral hygiene training for carers; oral hygiene training for people with ID; varying the scheduled intervals between dental visits and supervising toothbrushing; using discussion of clinical photographs as a motivator; varying how frequently the teeth of people with ID were brushed; using a plaque‐disclosing agent and using individualised oral care plans. The studies evaluated gingival inflammation (red and swollen gums) and plaque. Some studies evaluated carer knowledge, behaviour, attitude and self‐efficacy (belief in their competence) in terms of oral hygiene, as well as the oral hygiene behaviour and skills of people with ID. Tooth decay and quality of life were not measured. We grouped the studies according to when the outcomes were measured: short term (six weeks or less), medium term (between six weeks and 12 months) and long term (more than 12 months). Key results A special manual toothbrush (the Superbrush), used by carers, may be better at reducing levels of gingival inflammation and possibly plaque in people with ID than an ordinary manual toothbrush in the medium term, though this was not seen in the short term. We found no difference between electric and manual toothbrushes used by people with ID or their carers in terms of gingival inflammation or plaque in the medium term, and the short‐term results were unclear. Training carers to brush the teeth of people with ID may have improved carers' oral hygiene knowledge in the medium term. Training people with ID to brush their own teeth may have reduced the amount of plaque on their teeth in the short term. Regularly scheduled dental recall visits and carers supervising toothbrushing between visits may have been more likely than usual care to reduce gingival inflammation and plaque in the long term. Discussing clinical photographs of plaque on participants' teeth shown up by a disclosing agent, to motivate them to better toothbrushing did not seem to reduce plaque. Daily toothbrushing by a dental student may be more effective for reducing plaque levels in the short term than once or twice weekly professional toothbrushing. Toothpaste with a plaque‐disclosing agent and individualised oral care plans were each evaluated in one nonrandomised study that suggested they may be beneficial. Only one study set out to formally measure negative side effects; however, most studies commented that there were none. Some studies found that some people had difficulties with the electric or special manual toothbrushes. Certainty of the evidence Although some oral hygiene interventions for people with ID show scientific evidence of benefits, what these benefits actually mean for an individual's oral hygiene or oral health is unclear. The certainty of the evidence is mainly low or very low so future research may change our findings. Moderate‐certainty evidence is available for only one finding: electric and manual toothbrushes are probably similarly effective for reducing gingival inflammation in people with ID in the medium term. More and better research is needed to fully evaluate interventions that show promise for improving the oral hygiene of people with ID, and to confirm which interventions are ineffective. In the meantime, changes to current habits based on this review should be made cautiously, and decisions about oral hygiene care should be based on professional expertise and the needs and preferences of people with ID and their carers.","5","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Intellectual Disability; *Oral Health; *Oral Hygiene; Dental Plaque; Humans; Periodontal Diseases [*prevention & control]; Toothbrushing [methods]","10.1002/14651858.CD012628.pub2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD012628.pub2","Oral Health"
"CD007256.PUB2","Khan, F; Ng, L; Turner‐Stokes, L","Effectiveness of vocational rehabilitation intervention on the return to work and employment of persons with multiple sclerosis","Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","2009","Abstract - Background Multiple sclerosis is a neurological disease that frequently affects adults of working age, resulting in a range of physical, cognitive and psychosocial deficits that impact on workforce participation. Although, the literature supports vocational rehabilitation (VR) approaches in persons with multiple sclerosis (pwMS), the evidence for its effectiveness is yet to be established. Objectives To evaluate the effectiveness of VR programs compared to alternative programs or care as usual on return to work, workability and employment in pwMS; to evaluate the cost effectiveness of these programs. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Multiple Sclerosis Group's Trials Register (February 2011), PEDro (1990‐2011), ISI Science Citation Index (1981‐2011) the Cochrane Rehabilitation and Related Therapies Field trials Register and the National Health Service National Research Register. Selection criteria Randomized and controlled clinical trials, including before ‐ after controlled trials, that compare VR rehabilitation with alternative intervention such as standard or a lesser form of intervention or waitlist controls. Data collection and analysis Two reviewers selected trials and rated their methodological quality independently. A 'best evidence' synthesis was performed, based on methodological quality. Trials were grouped in terms of type and setting of VR programs. Main results Two trials (one RCT and one CCT) (total 80 participants) met the review criteria. Both trials scored poorly on the methodological quality assessment. There was 'insufficient evidence' for VR programs for (a)‘competitive employment’, in altering rates of job retention, changes in employment, improvement in rates of re‐entry into the labour force; (b) for altering ‘work ability' by improving participants’ confidence in the accommodation request process, or employability maturity or job seeking activity. No evidence could be assimilated for changes in proportions of persons in supported employment or on disability pensions, nor for cost‐effectiveness. Authors' conclusions There was inconclusive evidence to support VR for pwMS. However, the review highlights some of the challenges in providing VR for pwMS. Clinicians need to be aware of vocational issues, and to understand and manage barriers for maintaining employment. Proactive and timely VR programs should incorporate practical solutions to deal with work disability, workplace accommodation and educate employers, and the wider community. Liaison with policy makers is imperative for government initiatives that encourage work focused VR programs. Future research in VR should focus on improving methodological and scientific rigour of clinical trials; on the development of appropriate and valid outcome measures; and on cost effectiveness of VR programs. Plain language summary Vocational Rehabilitation (VR) programs are used to support persons with multiple sclerosis ( MS) on their entering or returning to work Major as well as minor disabilities, such as physical, psychosocial, environmental and memory/attention impairment, significantly affect the entering or the returning to work of persons with MS. The objective of this review was to assess the efficacy and to evaluate the cost effectiveness of VR programs compared to other types of programs. Among the pertinent medical literature, only two studies, comprising a total of 80 participants, met the criteria of the methodological quality necessary for their inclusion in this review, although the subsequent quality assessment revealed they scored poorly. Furthermore, the two studies were carried out in USA, with limited generalisability in other geographical/cultural settings. The whole data neither supports nor refutes the effectiveness or cost‐effectiveness of VR programs for persons with MS. The data also identified critical points worth of future attention: more awareness of vocational issues by professionals; putting in place practical solutions such as a proper workplace accommodations and employers' education; asking for political/governmental initiatives to really support disabled employees; taking into account that supported withdrawal from work at the proper time is as important as supported re‐entering to work. Further research are necessary also to improve the methodology of the researches and to identify those individuals most likely to benefit.","1","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Employment; *Rehabilitation, Vocational; Controlled Clinical Trials as Topic; Humans; Multiple Sclerosis [*rehabilitation]; Program Evaluation; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic","10.1002/14651858.CD007256.pub2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD007256.pub2","Multiple Sclerosis and Rare Diseases of the CNS"

Caregivers may experience a range of physical, emotional, financial and social harms, which are often described collectively as caregiver burden. The degree of burden experienced is associated with characteristics of the caregiver, such as gender, and characteristics of the person with dementia, such as dementia stage, and the presence of behavioural problems or neuropsychiatric disturbances. It is a strong predictor of admission to residential care for people with dementia. Psychoeducational interventions might prevent or reduce caregiver burden. Overall, they are intended to improve caregivers' knowledge about the disease and its care; to increase caregivers' sense of competence and their ability to cope with difficult situations; to relieve feelings of isolation and allow caregivers to attend to their own emotional and physical needs. These interventions are heterogeneous, varying in their theoretical framework, components, and delivery formats. Interventions that are delivered remotely, using printed materials, telephone or video technologies, may be particularly suitable for caregivers who have difficulty accessing face‐to‐face services because of their own health problems, poor access to transport, or absence of substitute care. During the COVID‐19 pandemic, containment measures in many countries required people to be isolated in their homes, including people with dementia and their family carers. In such circumstances, there is no alternative to remote delivery of interventions. Objectives To assess the efficacy and acceptability of remotely delivered interventions aiming to reduce burden and improve mood and quality of life of informal caregivers of people with dementia. Search methods We searched the Specialised Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group, MEDLINE, Embase and four other databases, as well as two international trials registries, on 10 April 2020. We also examined the bibliographies of relevant review papers and published trials. Selection criteria We included only randomised controlled trials that assessed the remote delivery of structured interventions for informal caregivers who were providing care for people with dementia living at home. Caregivers had to be unpaid adults (relatives or members of the person's community). The interventions could be delivered using printed materials, the telephone, the Internet or a mixture of these, but could not involve any face‐to‐face contact with professionals. We categorised intervention components as information, training or support. Information interventions included two key elements: (i) they provided standardised information, and (ii) the caregiver played a passive role. Support interventions promoted interaction with other people (professionals or peers). Training interventions trained caregivers in practical skills to manage care. We excluded interventions that were primarily individual psychotherapy. Our primary outcomes were caregiver burden, mood, health‐related quality of life and dropout for any reason. Secondary outcomes were caregiver knowledge and skills, use of health and social care resources, admission of the person with dementia to institutional care, and quality of life of the person with dementia. Data collection and analysis Study selection, data extraction and assessment of the risk of bias in included studies were done independently by two review authors. We used the Template for Intervention Description and Replication (TIDieR) to describe the interventions. We conducted meta‐analyses using a random‐effects model to derive estimates of effect size. We used GRADE methods to describe our degree of certainty about effect estimates. Main results We included 26 studies in this review (2367 participants). We compared (1) interventions involving training, support or both, with or without information (experimental interventions) with usual treatment, waiting list or attention control (12 studies, 944 participants); and (2) the same experimental interventions with provision of information alone (14 studies, 1423 participants). We downgraded evidence for study limitations and, for some outcomes, for inconsistency between studies. There was a frequent risk of bias from self‐rating of subjective outcomes by participants who were not blind to the intervention. Randomisation methods were not always well‐reported and there was potential for attrition bias in some studies. Therefore, all evidence was of moderate or low certainty. In the comparison of experimental interventions with usual treatment, waiting list or attention control, we found that the experimental interventions probably have little or no effect on caregiver burden (nine studies, 597 participants; standardised mean difference (SMD) ‐0.06, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐0.35 to 0.23); depressive symptoms (eight studies, 638 participants; SMD ‐0.05, 95% CI ‐0.22 to 0.12); or health‐related quality of life (two studies, 311 participants; SMD 0.10, 95% CI ‐0.13 to 0.32). The experimental interventions probably result in little or no difference in dropout for any reason (eight studies, 661 participants; risk ratio (RR) 1.15, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.53). In the comparison of experimental interventions with a control condition of information alone, we found that experimental interventions may result in a slight reduction in caregiver burden (nine studies, 650 participants; SMD ‐0.24, 95% CI ‐0.51 to 0.04); probably result in a slight improvement in depressive symptoms (11 studies, 1100 participants; SMD ‐0.25, 95% CI ‐0.43 to ‐0.06); may result in little or no difference in caregiver health‐related quality of life (two studies, 257 participants; SMD ‐0.03, 95% CI ‐0.28 to 0.21); and probably result in an increase in dropouts for any reason (12 studies, 1266 participants; RR 1.51, 95% CI 1.04 to 2.20). Authors' conclusions Remotely delivered interventions including support, training or both, with or without information, may slightly reduce caregiver burden and improve caregiver depressive symptoms when compared with provision of information alone, but not when compared with usual treatment, waiting list or attention control. They seem to make little or no difference to health‐related quality of life. Caregivers receiving training or support were more likely than those receiving information alone to drop out of the studies, which might limit applicability. The efficacy of these interventions may depend on the nature and availability of usual services in the study settings. Plain language summary Remotely delivered information, training and support for informal caregivers of people with dementia Review questions We were interested in remotely delivered interventions involving information, training and support for family caregivers of people with dementia. By remotely delivered, we meant that they were provided over the telephone or on a computer or mobile electronic device. We asked whether these kinds of intervention helped caregivers more than doing nothing, and also whether interventions that included elements of training and support worked better than simple provision of information about dementia. Background Caring for a family member or friend with dementia can offer positive experiences, but often also has negative consequences for the caregiver. These negative consequences may be emotional, physical, social and financial, and are sometimes described as caregiver 'burden.' Many interventions have been developed to try to help caregivers in their caring role. Often, these interventions involve several components. In this review we divided the intervention components into information (increasing caregivers' knowledge about dementia), training (helping them to practice important skills for successful caring) and support (providing an opportunity to share experiences and feelings with other people). We chose to review only interventions delivered remotely, in part because we were writing during the COVID‐19 pandemic, when many countries required people to remain in their homes. However, remotely delivered interventions may also be useful in many other kinds of situations when it is difficult for caregivers to access services in person. Study characteristics We searched up to April 2020 for randomised controlled trials that addressed our review questions. We found 12 studies with 944 participants that compared groups of caregivers receiving usual care, or some non‐specific contact with researchers, with other groups receiving remotely delivered interventions that involved information with training, support or both. We found another 14 studies with 1423 participants that compared simple information provision with more complex interventions that involved training or support. The interventions lasted an average of 16 weeks. Three studies took place in China; all the others were from North America or Europe. About half used the telephone and about half used the Internet to deliver the interventions. What are the main results of our review? Compared with the usual services provided for caregivers where the studies took place, or with non‐specific contact with the researchers, we found that the information, training and support interventions probably had no important effect on caregivers' overall burden, depressive symptoms, or quality of life. Caregivers in both groups may have been equally likely to drop out of the studies for any reason. Compared to information only, interventions which included training and support may result in a slight reduction of caregiver burden, probably reduce depressive symptoms, may have little or no effect on quality of life, and probably make it more likely that caregivers drop out of the studies. We did not find any obvious effects of different intervention components, but we were not able to draw any firm conclusions about this. There was no evidence on whether the interventions improved the quality of life of the people with dementia who were being cared for. We did not find any studies that reported harmful effects of the interventions or the additional burden they might add to the caregiver's life. We do not know how the interventions would perform in countries where few health and social care services are available for people with dementia and their families, or in situations where caregivers are unable to access usual services. How reliable are these results? We found that most studies were well‐conducted, but because most outcomes were subjective, there was a risk that the expectations of the caregivers and researchers could have influenced results. For some outcomes, there were inconsistent results among studies. Overall, our confidence in our findings was moderate or low so the results could be affected by further research.","1","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","Affect; Bias; Caregiver Burden [*prevention & control]; Caregivers [*education, psychology]; Dementia [*nursing]; Family; Health Services Accessibility [statistics & numerical data]; Health Services Needs and Demand [statistics & numerical data]; Humans; Institutionalization [statistics & numerical data]; Nursing Homes [statistics & numerical data]; Quality of Life; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic","10.1002/14651858.CD006440.pub3","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD006440.pub3","Dementia and Cognitive Improvement"

Infections caused by multidrug‐resistant bacteria are associated with prolonged hospital stay and death compared with infections caused by susceptible bacteria. Appropriate antibiotic use in hospitals should ensure effective treatment of patients with infection and reduce unnecessary prescriptions. We updated this systematic review to evaluate the impact of interventions to improve antibiotic prescribing to hospital inpatients. Objectives To estimate the effectiveness and safety of interventions to improve antibiotic prescribing to hospital inpatients and to investigate the effect of two intervention functions: restriction and enablement. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (the Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, and Embase. We searched for additional studies using the bibliographies of included articles and personal files. The last search from which records were evaluated and any studies identified incorporated into the review was January 2015. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and non‐randomised studies (NRS). We included three non‐randomised study designs to measure behavioural and clinical outcomes and analyse variation in the effects: non‐ randomised trials (NRT), controlled before‐after (CBA) studies and interrupted time series (ITS) studies. For this update we also included three additional NRS designs (case control, cohort, and qualitative studies) to identify unintended consequences. Interventions included any professional or structural interventions as defined by the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care Group. We defined restriction as 'using rules to reduce the opportunity to engage in the target behaviour (or increase the target behaviour by reducing the opportunity to engage in competing behaviours)'. We defined enablement as 'increasing means/reducing barriers to increase capability or opportunity'. The main comparison was between intervention and no intervention. Data collection and analysis Two review authors extracted data and assessed study risk of bias. We performed meta‐analysis and meta‐regression of RCTs and meta‐regression of ITS studies. We classified behaviour change functions for all interventions in the review, including those studies in the previously published versions. We analysed dichotomous data with a risk difference (RD). We assessed certainty of evidence with GRADE criteria. Main results This review includes 221 studies (58 RCTs, and 163 NRS). Most studies were from North America (96) or Europe (87). The remaining studies were from Asia (19), South America (8), Australia (8), and the East Asia (3). Although 62% of RCTs were at a high risk of bias, the results for the main review outcomes were similar when we restricted the analysis to studies at low risk of bias. More hospital inpatients were treated according to antibiotic prescribing policy with the intervention compared with no intervention based on 29 RCTs of predominantly enablement interventions (RD 15%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 14% to 16%; 23,394 participants; high‐certainty evidence). This represents an increase from 43% to 58% .There were high levels of heterogeneity of effect size but the direction consistently favoured intervention. The duration of antibiotic treatment decreased by 1.95 days (95% CI 2.22 to 1.67; 14 RCTs; 3318 participants; high‐certainty evidence) from 11.0 days. Information from non‐randomised studies showed interventions to be associated with improvement in prescribing according to antibiotic policy in routine clinical practice, with 70% of interventions being hospital‐wide compared with 31% for RCTs. The risk of death was similar between intervention and control groups (11% in both arms), indicating that antibiotic use can likely be reduced without adversely affecting mortality (RD 0%, 95% CI ‐1% to 0%; 28 RCTs; 15,827 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). Antibiotic stewardship interventions probably reduce length of stay by 1.12 days (95% CI 0.7 to 1.54 days; 15 RCTs; 3834 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). One RCT and six NRS raised concerns that restrictive interventions may lead to delay in treatment and negative professional culture because of breakdown in communication and trust between infection specialists and clinical teams (low‐certainty evidence). Both enablement and restriction were independently associated with increased compliance with antibiotic policies, and enablement enhanced the effect of restrictive interventions (high‐certainty evidence). Enabling interventions that included feedback were probably more effective than those that did not (moderate‐certainty evidence). There was very low‐certainty evidence about the effect of the interventions on reducing  Clostridium difficile  infections (median ‐48.6%, interquartile range ‐80.7% to ‐19.2%; 7 studies). This was also the case for resistant gram‐negative bacteria (median ‐12.9%, interquartile range ‐35.3% to 25.2%; 11 studies) and resistant gram‐positive bacteria (median ‐19.3%, interquartile range ‐50.1% to +23.1%; 9 studies). There was too much variance in microbial outcomes to reliably assess the effect of change in antibiotic use. Heterogeneity of intervention effect on prescribing outcomes We analysed effect modifiers in 29 RCTs and 91 ITS studies. Enablement and restriction were independently associated with a larger effect size (high‐certainty evidence). Feedback was included in 4 (17%) of 23 RCTs and 20 (47%) of 43 ITS studies of enabling interventions and was associated with greater intervention effect. Enablement was included in 13 (45%) of 29 ITS studies with restrictive interventions and enhanced intervention effect. Authors' conclusions We found high‐certainty evidence that interventions are effective in increasing compliance with antibiotic policy and reducing duration of antibiotic treatment. Lower use of antibiotics probably does not increase mortality and likely reduces length of stay. Additional trials comparing antibiotic stewardship with no intervention are unlikely to change our conclusions. Enablement consistently increased the effect of interventions, including those with a restrictive component. Although feedback further increased intervention effect, it was used in only a minority of enabling interventions. Interventions were successful in safely reducing unnecessary antibiotic use in hospitals, despite the fact that the majority did not use the most effective behaviour change techniques. Consequently, effective dissemination of our findings could have considerable health service and policy impact. Future research should instead focus on targeting treatment and assessing other measures of patient safety, assess different stewardship interventions, and explore the barriers and facilitators to implementation. More research is required on unintended consequences of restrictive interventions. Plain language summary Improving how physicians working in hospital settings prescribe antibiotics Review aim The aim of this Cochrane review was to learn of ways to improve how physicians working in hospital settings prescribe antibiotics. We collected and analysed all relevant studies to answer this question and found 221 studies. Key messages The use of an antibiotic policy leads to improved prescribing practices and decreases in the duration of antibiotic treatment. Interventions that are directed to physicians to improve their antibiotic prescribing practices reduced participant length of stay in hospitals by 1.12 days (based on findings from 15 studies) and did not increase the risk of death (based on findings from 29 studies). Interventions providing advice or feedback to physicians were more effective in improving prescribing practices than those interventions that did not provide this information to physicians. Evidence from seven studies raised concerns that with interventions applying rules to make physicians prescribe properly there were delays in treatment and a breakdown in trust between infection specialists and clinical teams. What was studied in the review? Antibiotics are used to treat bacterial infections such as pneumonia. Many bacteria have become resistant to antibiotics over time. Antibiotic resistance is a serious problem for patients and healthcare systems because infections caused by antibiotic‐resistant bacteria can lead to higher rates of death and longer hospital stays. Bacterial resistance often occurs because antibiotics are used when they are not needed. Studies have shown that in about half of cases physicians in hospital are not prescribing antibiotics properly. We investigated the effectiveness and safety of interventions to help physicians prescribe antibiotics properly and what techniques of behaviour change could influence the success of the interventions. Key results We found 221 relevant studies. Ninety‐six studies were from North America. The remaining 125 studies were from Europe (87), Asia (19), South America (8), Australia (8), and East Asia (3). The studies tested interventions that fell broadly into two categories: restrictive techniques, which apply rules to make physicians prescribe properly, and enablement techniques, which provide advice or feedback to help physicians prescribe properly. We found high‐certainty evidence that interventions lead to more hospital inpatients receiving the appropriate treatment for their condition according to antibiotic prescribing policies. We found moderate‐certainty evidence that interventions reduce the length of hospital stay without increasing patient deaths. Both restriction and enabling techniques were successful in achieving effectiveness of the intervention. We do not need more studies to answer the question of whether these interventions reduce unnecessary antibiotic use, but we do need more research to understand the unintended consequences of the use of restrictive interventions. Interventions were successful in safely reducing unnecessary antibiotic use in hospitals, despite the fact that the majority did not use a widely adopted behaviour change technique, which is to audit and provide feedback on performance. Effective communication of the review results could have considerable health service and policy impact. How up‐to‐date is the review?

Such advice may be brief, or part of more intensive interventions. Objectives To determine the effectiveness of nursing‐delivered smoking cessation interventions in adults. To establish whether nursing‐delivered smoking cessation interventions are more effective than no intervention; are more effective if the intervention is more intensive; differ in effectiveness with health state and setting of the participants; are more effective if they include follow‐ups; are more effective if they include aids that demonstrate the pathophysiological effect of smoking. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group Specialized Register and CINAHL in January 2017. Selection criteria Randomized trials of smoking cessation interventions delivered by nurses or health visitors with follow‐up of at least six months. Data collection and analysis Two review authors extracted data independently. The main outcome measure was abstinence from smoking after at least six months of follow‐up. We used the most rigorous definition of abstinence for each trial, and biochemically‐validated rates if available. Where statistically and clinically appropriate, we pooled studies using a Mantel‐Haenszel fixed‐effect model and reported the outcome as a risk ratio (RR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI). Main results Fifty‐eight studies met the inclusion criteria, nine of which are new for this update. Pooling 44 studies (over 20,000 participants) comparing a nursing intervention to a control or to usual care, we found the intervention increased the likelihood of quitting (RR 1.29, 95% CI 1.21 to 1.38); however, statistical heterogeneity was moderate (I 2  = 50%) and not explained by subgroup analysis. Because of this, we judged the quality of evidence to be moderate. Despite most studies being at unclear risk of bias in at least one domain, we did not downgrade the quality of evidence further, as restricting the main analysis to only those studies at low risk of bias did not significantly alter the effect estimate. Subgroup analyses found no evidence that high‐intensity interventions, interventions with additional follow‐up or interventions including aids that demonstrate the pathophysiological effect of smoking are more effective than lower intensity interventions, or interventions without additional follow‐up or aids. There was no evidence that the effect of support differed by patient group or across healthcare settings. Authors' conclusions There is moderate quality evidence that behavioural support to motivate and sustain smoking cessation delivered by nurses can lead to a modest increase in the number of people who achieve prolonged abstinence. There is insufficient evidence to assess whether more intensive interventions, those incorporating additional follow‐up, or those incorporating pathophysiological feedback are more effective than one‐off support. There was no evidence that the effect of support differed by patient group or across healthcare settings. Plain language summary Does support and intervention from nurses help people to stop smoking? Background Most smokers want to quit, and may be helped by advice and support from healthcare professionals. Nurses are the largest healthcare workforce, and are involved in virtually all levels of health care. The main aim of this review was to determine if nursing‐delivered interventions can help adult smokers to stop smoking. Study characteristics This review of clinical trials covered 58 studies in which nurses delivered a stop‐smoking intervention to smokers. More than 20,000 participants were included in the main analysis, including hospitalized adults and adults in the general community. The most recent search was conducted in January 2017. All studies reported whether or not participants had quit smoking at six months or longer. Key Results This review found moderate‐quality evidence that advice and support from nurses could increase people's success in quitting smoking, whether in hospitals or in community settings. Eleven studies compared different nurse‐delivered interventions and did not find that adding more components changed the effect. Quality of evidence The quality of evidence was moderate, meaning that further research may change our confidence in the result. This is because results were not consistent across all of the studies, and in some cases there were not very many studies contributing to comparisons.","12","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Counseling; *Practice Patterns, Nurses'; *Smoking Prevention; Adult; Female; Humans; Male; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Smoking Cessation [*statistics & numerical data]","10.1002/14651858.CD001188.pub5","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD001188.pub5","Tobacco Addiction"

Although there is a growing evidence base on the effectiveness and cost‐effectiveness of Hospital at Home, health service managers, health professionals and policy makers require evidence on how to implement and sustain these services on a wider scale. Objectives (1) To identify, appraise and synthesise qualitative research evidence on the factors that influence the implementation of Admission Avoidance Hospital at Home and Early Discharge Hospital at Home, from the perspective of multiple stakeholders, including policy makers, health service managers, health professionals, patients and patients’ caregivers. (2) To explore how our synthesis findings relate to, and help to explain, the findings of the Cochrane intervention reviews of Admission Avoidance Hospital at Home and Early Discharge Hospital at Home services. Search methods We searched MEDLINE, CINAHL, Global Index Medicus and Scopus until 17 November 2022. We also applied reference checking and citation searching to identify additional studies. We searched for studies in any language. Selection criteria We included qualitative studies and mixed‐methods studies with qualitative data collection and analysis methods examining the implementation of new or existing Hospital at Home services from the perspective of different stakeholders. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently selected the studies, extracted study characteristics and intervention components, assessed the methodological limitations using the Critical Appraisal Skills Checklist (CASP) and assessed the confidence in the findings using GRADE‐CERQual (Confidence in the Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative research). We applied thematic synthesis to synthesise the data across studies and identify factors that may influence the implementation of Hospital at Home. Main results From 7535 records identified from database searches and one identified from citation tracking, we included 52 qualitative studies exploring the implementation of Hospital at Home services (31 Early Discharge, 16 Admission Avoidance, 5 combined services), across 13 countries and from the perspectives of 662 service‐level staff (clinicians, managers), eight systems‐level staff (commissioners, insurers), 900 patients and 417 caregivers. Overall, we judged 40 studies as having minor methodological concerns and we judged 12 studies as having major concerns. Main concerns included data collection methods (e.g. not reporting a topic guide), data analysis methods (e.g. insufficient data to support findings) and not reporting ethical approval. Following synthesis, we identified 12 findings graded as high (n = 10) and moderate (n = 2) confidence and classified them into four themes: (1) development of stakeholder relationships and systems prior to implementation, (2) processes, resources and skills required for safe and effective implementation, (3) acceptability and caregiver impacts, and (4) sustainability of services. Authors' conclusions Implementing Admission Avoidance and Early Discharge Hospital at Home services requires early development of policies, stakeholder engagement, efficient admission processes, effective communication and a skilled workforce to safely and effectively implement person‐centred Hospital at Home, achieve acceptance by staff who refer patients to these services and ensure sustainability. Future research should focus on lower‐income country and rural settings, and the perspectives of systems‐level stakeholders, and explore the potential negative impact on caregivers, especially for Admission Avoidance Hospital at Home, as this service may become increasingly utilised to manage rising visits to emergency departments. Plain language summary Multiple perceptions about implementing hospital at home Key messages ‐ When developing a Hospital at Home service, it is important to set up a straightforward process for healthcare professionals to refer patients. This includes producing clear guidelines that set out who the service is suitable for. ‐ Hospital at Home services need a trained workforce with skills to deliver safe and effective patient‐centred care in the home, with clear and consistent communication between staff, patients and caregivers. ‐ We propose a number of questions for use by healthcare professionals and managers when introducing new Hospital at Home services, or running existing services. The questions are intended to help plan for and implement Hospital at Home services and improve satisfaction and outcomes for staff, patients and caregivers. What is Hospital at Home? Hospital at Home provides hospital‐level care at home, for people who would otherwise be inpatients in hospital. One type of Hospital at Home is to avoid admission to hospital. This is called Admission Avoidance Hospital at Home. These services replace an admission to hospital, for people whose condition would normally need treatment in a hospital bed, for example for a flare‐up of a lung condition. Instead, a doctor can refer a patient they assess as being suitable to receive treatment for an illness in their own home (or the place where they usually live, including in residential care), for a limited time. Another type is called Early Discharge Hospital at Home. These services shorten the length of time people need to stay in hospital after being admitted as an inpatient, for example following surgery or treatment for an illness or condition. The care patients would usually receive from healthcare professionals in a hospital bed is instead provided in their home, and is not expected to compromise the quality of care. What did we want to find out? Our aim was to find out what is important when introducing, running and receiving care from Hospital at Home services. We wanted to explore a range of experiences of, and views on, Admission Avoidance and Early Discharge services. These might include things that managers want to know when planning to set up a Hospital at Home service, healthcare professionals’ views on working in a Hospital at Home service, what matters to patients who receive this type of care, or how family and caregivers experience Hospital at Home services for those they care for. What did we do? We searched for research that had explored experiences, attitudes or beliefs about Hospital at Home services from the perspectives of patients, caregivers, health professionals, managers and health funders. The studies addressed existing Hospital at Home services and those that were being set up, for people with a range of conditions, such as stroke, pneumonia or following surgery. The studies used interviews or focus groups to explore the views of people involved in delivering or receiving Hospital at Home services. We assessed and summarised the findings from each of the studies. We identified important findings across the studies, and then rated how confident we were in each finding. This confidence (or trust) depended on, for example, how much information relating to a particular finding had been provided in the studies. What did we find? We found 52 studies that explored Hospital at Home services, including 31 Early Discharge, 16 Admission Avoidance and five combined Early Discharge and Admission Avoidance services. These studies conducted interviews or focus groups with 662 healthcare staff, 900 patients, 417 caregivers and eight health funders. In total, we identified 12 main findings after assessing all the studies. We grouped these findings as: (1) development of stakeholder relationships and systems prior to implementation, (2) processes, resources and skills required for safe and effective delivery, (3) acceptability and caregiver impacts and (4) sustainability of services. We are confident in most of our findings, but we are less confident in a few findings, mainly due to the small numbers of studies and interviews with health funders contributing to the review finding. What are the limitations of the evidence? All except one of the studies came from high‐income countries, and so our findings may not apply to low‐ and middle‐income countries. Some studies did not report all the information that might be useful. For example, services’ staffing and role types were not always included. How up‐to‐date is this evidence? The evidence is up‐to‐date to November 2022.","3","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Hospitalization; *Patient Discharge; Administrative Personnel; Checklist; Hospitals; Humans","10.1002/14651858.CD014765.pub2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD014765.pub2","Effective Practice and Organisation of Care"

Main results We included two interrupted time‐series studies conducted in the USA. One study was conducted in five large US transportation companies (N = 115,019) that carried passengers and/or cargo. Monthly injury rates were available from 1983 to 1999. In the study company, two interventions of interest were evaluated: mandatory random drug testing and mandatory random and for‐cause alcohol testing programmes. The third study focused only on mandatory random drug testing and was conducted on federal injury data that covered all truck drivers of interstate carriers. We recalculated the results from raw data provided by the study authors. Following reanalysis, we found that in one study mandatory random and for‐cause alcohol testing was associated with a significant decrease in the level of injuries immediately following the intervention (‐1.25 injuries/100 person years, 95% CI ‐2.29 to ‐0.21) but did not significantly affect the existing long‐term downward trend (‐0.28 injuries/100 person years/year, 95% CI ‐0.78 to 0.21). Mandatory random drug testing was significantly associated with an immediate change in injury level following the intervention (1.26 injuries/100 person years, 95% CI 0.36 to 2.16) in one study, and in the second study there was no significant effect (‐1.36/injuries/100 person years, 95% CI ‐1.69 to 0.41). In the long term, random drug testing was associated with a significant increase in the downward trend (‐0.19 injuries/100 person years/year, 95% CI ‐0.30 to ‐0.07) in one study, the other study was also associated with a significant improvement in the long‐term downward trend (‐0.83 fatal accidents/100 million vehicle miles/year, 95% CI ‐1.08 to ‐0.58). Authors' conclusions There is insufficient evidence to advise for or against the use of drug and alcohol testing of occupational drivers for preventing injuries as a sole, effective, long‐term solution in the context of workplace culture, peer interaction and other local factors. Cluster‐randomised trials are needed to better address the effects of interventions for injury prevention in this occupational setting. Plain language summary Alcohol and drug screening for preventing injury among people whose job involves driving Alcohol and drug abuse are serious public health problems worldwide. Workplace alcohol and drug testing is a common intervention, especially in developed nations, but it is costly and its use is controversial. This systematic review aimed to assess the effects of alcohol and drug screening among occupational drivers for preventing injury. We conducted a systematic search of the literature on the effects of alcohol and drug screening among occupational drivers for preventing injury. We then appraised the quality of the studies found and assessed their results. We found two time‐series studies conducted in the USA. One was conducted in five large transportation companies, and it examined the effects of two interventions of interest: implementation of legislation for mandatory random drug testing and mandatory random and for‐cause alcohol testing. The other study was conducted using national injury data. There is limited evidence that in the long term mandatory drug‐testing interventions can be more effective than no intervention in reducing injuries in occupational drivers. For mandatory alcohol testing there was evidence of an immediate effect only. Given the widespread practice of alcohol and drug testing and the paucity of evaluation studies found, more evaluation studies are needed. Interrupted time‐series is a feasible study design for evaluating interventions that aim at preventing alcohol and drug related injuries. However, time‐series studies of higher quality and of long duration are needed to increase the level of evidence. A cluster‐randomised trial would be the ideal study design to evaluate the effects of interventions for injury prevention in this occupational setting.","2","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Motor Vehicles [statistics & numerical data]; *Substance Abuse Detection; Accidents, Occupational [*prevention & control, statistics & numerical data]; Alcoholism [diagnosis]; Humans; Substance‐Related Disorders [*diagnosis]; United States [epidemiology]; Workplace; Wounds and Injuries [epidemiology, *prevention & control]","10.1002/14651858.CD006566.pub2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD006566.pub2","Injuries"

Favipiravir was suggested by some experts to be effective and safe to use in COVID‐19. Although this drug has been evaluated in randomized controlled trials (RCTs), it is still unclear if it has a definite role in the treatment of COVID‐19. Objectives To assess the effects of favipiravir compared to no treatment, supportive treatment, or other experimental antiviral treatment in people with acute COVID‐19. Search methods We searched the Cochrane COVID‐19 Study Register, MEDLINE, Embase, the World Health Organization (WHO) COVID‐19 Global literature on coronavirus disease, and three other databases, up to 18 July 2023. Selection criteria We searched for RCTs evaluating the efficacy of favipiravir in treating people with COVID‐19. Data collection and analysis We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures for data collection and analysis. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence for each outcome. Main results We included 25 trials that randomized 5750 adults (most under 60 years of age). The trials were conducted in Bahrain, Brazil, China, India, Iran, Kuwait, Malaysia, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Thailand, the UK, and the USA. Most participants were hospitalized with mild to moderate disease (89%). Twenty‐two of the 25 trials investigated the role of favipiravir compared to placebo or standard of care, whilst lopinavir/ritonavir was the comparator in two trials, and umifenovir in one trial. Most trials (24 of 25) initiated favipiravir at 1600 mg or 1800 mg twice daily for the first day, followed by 600 mg to 800 mg twice a day. The duration of treatment varied from five to 14 days. We do not know whether favipiravir reduces all‐cause mortality at 28 to 30 days, or in‐hospital (risk ratio (RR) 0.84, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.49 to 1.46; 11 trials, 3459 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). We do not know if favipiravir reduces the progression to invasive mechanical ventilation (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.09; 8 trials, 1383 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). Favipiravir may make little to no difference in the need for admission to hospital (if ambulatory) (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.44 to 2.46; 4 trials, 670 participants; low‐certainty evidence). We do not know if favipiravir reduces the time to clinical improvement (defined as time to a 2‐point reduction in patients’ admission status on the WHO’s ordinal scale) (hazard ratio (HR) 1.13, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.83; 4 trials, 721 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). Favipiravir may make little to no difference to the progression to oxygen therapy (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.75; 2 trials, 543 participants; low‐certainty evidence). Favipiravir may lead to an overall increased incidence of adverse events (RR 1.27, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.54; 18 trials, 4699 participants; low‐certainty evidence), but may result in little to no difference inserious adverse eventsattributable to the drug (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.42; 12 trials, 3317 participants; low‐certainty evidence). Authors' conclusions The low‐ to very low‐certainty evidence means that we do not know whether favipiravir is efficacious in people with COVID‐19 illness, irrespective of severity or admission status. Treatment with favipiravir may result in an overall increase in the incidence of adverse events but may not result in serious adverse events. Plain language summary Is favipiravir useful in treating people with COVID‐19? Key messages Due to a lack of robust evidence, we are unclear if favipiravir provides any benefit in the treatment of people with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) infections who do not require hospital admission, as well as those admitted to hospital. Favipiravir might lead to mild side effects, but doesn't seem to cause major or severe side effects. What is favipiravir? Favipiravir is a medicine that can fight viruses. It is usually taken by mouth. Originally used for treating other viral infections, favipiravir has been suggested as a potential treatment for COVID‐19 as it prevents the reproduction of the virus. Medical regulators have approved favipiravir for emergency use to treat people with COVID‐19. What did we want to find out? We wanted to find out if favipiravir was better than no treatment, supportive treatment, or any other experimental antiviral treatment for people with COVID‐19, in terms of death, need for a breathing machine (mechanical ventilation), and other outcomes. We also wanted to find out if favipiravir was associated with any unwanted effects. What did we do? We searched for studies that compared favipiravir with no treatment, supportive treatment, or other antiviral treatment in people with COVID‐19 disease. We compared and summarized the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. What did we find? We found 25 relevant studies involving 5750 people. The studies were conducted in 13 different countries: Bahrain, Brazil, China, India, Iran, Kuwait, Malaysia, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Thailand, the UK, and the USA. Most people were under 60 years old and had mild to moderate COVID‐19 symptoms. What are the main results of our review? • We do not know if favipiravir reduces the number of people who die from COVID‐19 when compared to dummy treatment, standard of care, or other antiviral medicines. The evidence supporting this is not very strong (derived from 11 studies involving 3459 people). • It is also very unclear if favipiravir reduces the need for people to be put on ventilators compared to a dummy treatment or any other antiviral treatments (derived from 8 studies involving 1383 people). • In people with mild symptoms, using favipiravir may not reduce the likelihood of needing hospitalization, but more research is needed to be sure (derived from 4 studies involving 670 people). • Favipiravir has an unclear effect on the time it takes for people to improve, as defined by a reduction in their illness severity (derived from 4 studies involving 721 people). • Favipiravir seems to make very little difference in reducing the need for treatment with oxygen, compared to a dummy treatment or other antiviral treatment (derived from 2 studies involving 543 people). • Favipiravir might lead to mild side effects (derived from 18 studies involving 4699 people) but doesn't seem to cause major or severe side effects (derived from 12 studies involving 3317 people). What are the limitations of the evidence? Our confidence in the evidence for using favipiravir is limited because people in the studies had different disease severities and the studies were of varying sizes and had inconsistent results. How up to date is the review? The review considered evidence up to 18 July 2023.","2","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*COVID-19; Adult; Amides [therapeutic use]; Humans; Pyrazines [adverse effects]; SARS-CoV-2","10.1002/14651858.CD015219.pub2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD015219.pub2","Infectious Diseases"

Non‐medical prescribing involves nurses, pharmacists, allied health professionals, and physician assistants substituting for doctors in a prescribing role, and this is one approach to improve access to medicines. Objectives To assess clinical, patient‐reported, and resource use outcomes of non‐medical prescribing for managing acute and chronic health conditions in primary and secondary care settings compared with medical prescribing (usual care). Search methods We searched databases including CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and five other databases on 19 July 2016. We also searched the grey literature and handsearched bibliographies of relevant papers and publications. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster‐RCTs, controlled before‐and‐after (CBA) studies (with at least two intervention and two control sites) and interrupted time series analysis (with at least three observations before and after the intervention) comparing: 1. non‐medical prescribing versus medical prescribing in acute care; 2. non‐medical prescribing versus medical prescribing in chronic care; 3. non‐medical prescribing versus medical prescribing in secondary care; 4 non‐medical prescribing versus medical prescribing in primary care; 5. comparisons between different non‐medical prescriber groups; and 6. non‐medical healthcare providers with formal prescribing training versus those without formal prescribing training. Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Two review authors independently reviewed studies for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed study quality with discrepancies resolved by discussion. Two review authors independently assessed risk of bias for the included studies according to EPOC criteria. We undertook meta‐analyses using the fixed‐effect model where studies were examining the same treatment effect and to account for small sample sizes. We compared outcomes to a random‐effects model where clinical or statistical heterogeneity existed. Main results We included 46 studies (37,337 participants); non‐medical prescribing was undertaken by nurses in 26 studies and pharmacists in 20 studies. In 45 studies non‐medical prescribing as a component of care was compared with usual care medical prescribing. A further study compared nurse prescribing supported by guidelines with usual nurse prescribing care. No studies were found with non‐medical prescribing being undertaken by other health professionals. The education requirement for non‐medical prescribing varied with country and location. A meta‐analysis of surrogate markers of chronic disease (systolic blood pressure, glycated haemoglobin, and low‐density lipoprotein) showed positive intervention group effects. There was a moderate‐certainty of evidence for studies of blood pressure at 12 months (mean difference (MD) ‐5.31 mmHg, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐6.46 to ‐4.16; 12 studies, 4229 participants) and low‐density lipoprotein (MD ‐0.21, 95% CI ‐0.29 to ‐0.14; 7 studies, 1469 participants); we downgraded the certainty of evidence from high due to considerations of serious inconsistency (considerable heterogeneity), multifaceted interventions, and variable prescribing autonomy. A high‐certainty of evidence existed for comparative studies of glycated haemoglobin management at 12 months (MD ‐0.62, 95% CI ‐0.85 to ‐0.38; 6 studies, 775 participants). While there appeared little difference in medication adherence across studies, a meta‐analysis of continuous outcome data from four studies showed an effect favouring patient adherence in the non‐medical prescribing group (MD 0.15, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.30; 4 studies, 700 participants). We downgraded the certainty of evidence for adherence to moderate due to the serious risk of performance bias. While little difference was seen in patient‐related adverse events between treatment groups, we downgraded the certainty of evidence to low due to indirectness, as the range of adverse events may not be related to the intervention and selective reporting failed to adequately report adverse events in many studies. Patients were generally satisfied with non‐medical prescriber care (14 studies, 7514 participants). We downgraded the certainty of evidence from high to moderate due to indirectness, in that satisfaction with the prescribing component of care was only addressed in one study, and there was variability of satisfaction measures with little use of validated tools. A meta‐analysis of health‐related quality of life scores (SF‐12 and SF‐36) found a difference favouring non‐medical prescriber care for the physical component score (MD 1.17, 95% CI 0.16 to 2.17), and the mental component score (MD 0.58, 95% CI ‐0.40 to 1.55). However, the quality of life measurement may more appropriately reflect composite care rather than the prescribing component of care, and for this reason we downgraded the certainty of evidence to moderate due to indirectness of the measure of effect. A wide variety of resource use measures were reported across studies with little difference between groups for hospitalisations, emergency department visits, and outpatient visits. In the majority of studies reporting medication use, non‐medical prescribers prescribed more drugs, intensified drug doses, and used a greater variety of drugs compared to usual care medical prescribers. The risk of bias across studies was generally low for selection bias (random sequence generation), detection bias (blinding of outcome assessment), attrition bias (incomplete outcome data), and reporting bias (selective reporting). There was an unclear risk of selection bias (allocation concealment) and for other biases. A high risk of performance bias (blinding of participants and personnel) existed. Authors' conclusions The findings suggest that non‐medical prescribers, practising with varying but high levels of prescribing autonomy, in a range of settings, were as effective as usual care medical prescribers. Non‐medical prescribers can deliver comparable outcomes for systolic blood pressure, glycated haemoglobin, low‐density lipoprotein, medication adherence, patient satisfaction, and health‐related quality of life. It was difficult to determine the impact of non‐medical prescribing compared to medical prescribing for adverse events and resource use outcomes due to the inconsistency and variability in reporting across studies. Future efforts should be directed towards more rigorous studies that can clearly identify the clinical, patient‐reported, resource use, and economic outcomes of non‐medical prescribing, in both high‐income and low‐income countries. Plain language summary Prescribing roles for health professionals other than doctors What is the aim of this review? The aim of this Cochrane review was to find out if prescribing by health professionals other than doctors delivers comparable outcomes to prescribing by doctors. Cochrane researchers collected and analysed all relevant studies to answer this question and found 46 studies. Key messages With appropriate training and support, nurses and pharmacists are able to prescribe medicines as part of managing a range of conditions to achieve comparable health management outcomes to doctors. The majority of studies focus on chronic disease management in higher‐income counties where there is generally a moderate‐certainty of evidence supporting similar outcomes for the markers of disease in high blood pressure, diabetes, and high cholesterol. Further high‐quality studies are needed in poorer countries and to better quantify differences in prescribing outcomes for adverse events, and to determine health economic outcomes. Further studies could also focus more specifically on the prescribing component of care. What was studied in the review? A number of countries allow health professionals other than doctors to prescribe medicines. This shift in roles is thought to provide improved and timely access to medicines for consumers where there are shortages of doctors or the health system is facing pressures in coping with the burden of disease. In addition, this task shift has been supported by a number of governments as a way to more appropriately use the skills of health professionals, such as nurses and pharmacists, in the care of patients. We compared the outcomes of any healthcare workers who were prescribing with a high degree of autonomy with medical prescribers in the hospital or community setting in low‐, middle‐ and high‐income countries. What are the main results of the review? This review found 45 studies where nurses and pharmacists with high levels of prescribing autonomy were compared with usual care medical prescribers. A further study compared nurse prescribing with guideline support with usual nurse prescribing care. No studies were found with other health professionals or lay prescribers. Four nurse prescribing studies were undertaken in the low‐ and middle‐income settings of Colombia, South Africa, Uganda, and Thailand. The remainder of studies were undertaken in high‐income Western countries. Forty‐two studies were based in a community setting, two studies were located in hospitals, one study in the workplace, and one study in an aged care facility. Prescribing was but one part of many health‐related interventions, particularly in the management of chronic disease. The review found that the outcomes for non‐medical prescribers were comparable to medical prescribers for: high blood pressure (moderate‐certainty of evidence); diabetes control (high‐certainty of evidence); high cholesterol (moderate‐certainty of evidence); adverse events (low‐certainty of evidence); patients adhering to their medication regimens (moderate‐certainty of evidence); patient satisfaction with care (moderate‐certainty of evidence); and health‐related quality of life (moderate‐certainty of evidence). Pharmacists and nurses with varying levels of undergraduate, postgraduate, and specific on‐the‐job training related to the disease or condition were able to deliver comparable prescribing outcomes to doctors. Non‐medical prescribers frequently had medical support available to facilitate a collaborative practice model. How up‐to‐date is this review?

If a person is exposed to the disease risk through medical treatment, they may need to be notified of this to prevent them passing the risk to others in healthcare settings and to enable additional infection control measures to be put in place for certain procedures. As CJD is incurable, and unable to be screened for or effectively treated, communicating this risk information after an exposure incident may have significant implications for the person at risk, their families/ carers and healthcare professionals. The best ways to notify people of their exposure to the risk of CJD or vCJD, and to support them subsequently, are currently unknown. Objectives To evaluate the effects of interventions to notify and support consumers (patients and their family members or carers) in situations where exposure to the risk of CJD or vCJD has occurred as a result of medical treatment (iatrogenically), on consumer, healthcare provider and healthcare system outcomes. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Consumers and Communication Review Group Specialised Register (10 February, 2009), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL,  The Cochrane Library,  Issue 1 2009), MEDLINE (OVID SP), EMBASE (OVID SP), PsycINFO (OVID SP), CINAHL (EBSCO Host), Current Contents (OVID SP) and Dissertation Abstracts (Proquest) from start date to February 2009. We searched MEDLINE In‐process and Other Non‐indexed Citations (OVID SP) and Sociological Abstracts (CSA) in November 2009. We searched reference lists, websites, and contacted consumer groups and experts for details of relevant research. Selection criteria Randomised and quasi‐randomised controlled studies, controlled before‐and‐after studies and interrupted time series analyses assessing the effects of any intervention to communicate with (notify or support) people exposed to the risk of CJD or vCJD through medical treatment were included. We sought outcomes relevant to consumers, health providers and health services, including both benefits and harms. Data collection and analysis Cochrane review Two authors independently assessed studies for inclusion against selection criteria, and would have applied standard Cochrane review methodology were any studies identified. Thematic synthesis We also conducted a thematic synthesis by systematically identifying and screening those studies that met the same population, intervention and outcome criteria as the Cochrane review, but that were identified from the broader literature providing evidence on policy implementation and consumer experiences. We systematically extracted and synthesised the data from these studies to produce a thematic synthesis, presented in appendices to this Cochrane review, which assembles evidence on the views, experiences and acceptability of notification and support strategies for people at risk. Main results Results of the Cochrane review No studies meeting the study design criteria were identified for inclusion in this Cochrane review. Results of thematic synthesis In total, 49 studies and pieces of literature meeting the same population, intervention and outcome criteria as the Cochrane review, but identified from the broader literature providing evidence on policy implementation and consumer experiences, were included and formed the basis of a thematic synthesis, and which is presented in appendices to this Cochrane review. The thematic synthesis indicates that ideally communication may be considered as a longitudinal multicomponent programme, ensuring that notification and support are coordinated; that communication is tailored and responsive to need; and that activities to support individual risk communication, such as widespread education and monitoring of access to health care for those at risk, are in place. The thematic synthesis also indicates that poor communication practices may have negative impacts or cause harm, such as discrimination in accessing health care. Authors' conclusions There is insufficient rigorous evidence to determine the effects of interventions to notify people at CJD or vCJD risk and to support them subsequently, or to identify the best approach to communication in these situations. The thematic synthesis can be used to inform policy and practice decisions for communicating with people at risk in the absence of rigorous evaluative studies. Plain language summary Notification and support for people exposed to the risk of Creutzfeldt‐Jakob disease (CJD) (or other prion diseases) through medical treatment CJD and variant CJD (vCJD) are rare and fatal diseases with very long incubation periods. While CJD can occur spontaneously or genetically, this review focuses on those forms of CJD and vCJD in which the disease risk has been acquired through one of a small number of specific medical procedures (iatrogenically), such as brain surgery or the use of human pituitary hormone products. Routine healthcare sterilisation techniques may not completely destroy the infectious agent responsible for causing CJD or vCJD. If a person is exposed to the disease risk through medical treatment, they may need to be notified of this to prevent them passing the risk to others in healthcare settings, and additional infection control measures may be needed for some procedures. As there is no screening test or effective treatment for CJD or vCJD, communicating this risk information after a healthcare incident where exposure to risk occurred may have a significant impact on the person at risk, their family members or carers, and their healthcare professionals. With no way to test for CJD or vCJD, those exposed to risk can be told only that they are at an increased risk of developing the disease. The seriousness of the disease and the uncertainty of the risk can make notification a highly distressing event, and may cause significant anxiety and psychological harm. Notification of risk and living with at‐risk status may also lead to ongoing problems over time, such as delays or discrimination in accessing routine or other health care. For these reasons, communication about CJD and vCJD risk must be considered carefully. The risk information must be conveyed in a way that causes the least harm to individuals and their families. However, the best ways to notify people of their exposure to the risk of CJD or vCJD, and to support them after notification, are not known. These questions were the subject of this review. That CJD and vCJD are very rare diseases creates challenges for researchers aiming to conduct rigorous quantitative studies in this area. Although we searched widely to identify all relevant research evaluating the effects of interventions to communicate with (notify and support) people at risk, we did not identify any studies that met the criteria for inclusion in this Cochrane review. However, systematic searches did identify a number of pieces of relevant research and literature that provided evidence about policy implementation and consumer experiences in situations of iatrogenic exposure to risk. This research formed the basis of a thematic synthesis. The synthesis identified several activities that aim to improve the experiences of people at risk of CJD and vCJD. It indicates that communication may be best considered as a longitudinal multicomponent programme occurring over time, ensuring that notification is coordinated and considers impact; that support is in place and is offered over time; that communication is flexible, tailored and responsive to need; and that supporting activities, such as widespread education of the healthcare workforce, the public and the media, and monitoring of access to health care for those at risk, are in place. The thematic synthesis also indicates that poor communication practices may have negative impacts or cause harm, such as discrimination in accessing health care. In the absence of rigorous evaluative studies the results of this thematic synthesis can be used to inform policy and practice decisions for communicating with people at risk.","3","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Disease Notification; *Iatrogenic Disease [epidemiology]; Creutzfeldt‐Jakob Syndrome [epidemiology, *transmission]; Humans; Prion Diseases [epidemiology, transmission]","10.1002/14651858.CD007578.pub2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD007578.pub2","Consumers and Communication"

Objectives 1. To categorize workplace interventions for smoking cessation tested in controlled studies and to determine the extent to which they help workers to stop smoking.  2. To collect and evaluate data on costs and cost effectiveness associated with workplace interventions. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group Specialized Register (July 2013), MEDLINE (1966 ‐ July 2013), EMBASE (1985 ‐ June 2013), and PsycINFO (to June 2013), amongst others. We searched abstracts from international conferences on tobacco and the bibliographies of identified studies and reviews for additional references. Selection criteria We selected interventions conducted in the workplace to promote smoking cessation. We included only randomized and quasi‐randomized controlled trials allocating individuals, workplaces, or companies to intervention or control conditions. Data collection and analysis One author extracted information relating to the characteristics and content of all kinds of interventions, participants, outcomes and methods of the studies, and a second author checked them. For this update we have conducted meta‐analyses of the main interventions, using the generic inverse variance method to generate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals. Main results We include 57 studies (61 comparisons) in this updated review. We found 31 studies of workplace interventions aimed at individual workers, covering group therapy, individual counselling, self‐help materials, nicotine replacement therapy, and social support, and 30 studies testing interventions applied to the workplace as a whole, i.e. environmental cues, incentives, and comprehensive programmes. The trials were generally of moderate to high quality, with results that were consistent with those found in other settings. Group therapy programmes (odds ratio (OR) for cessation 1.71, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.05 to 2.80; eight trials, 1309 participants), individual counselling (OR 1.96, 95% CI 1.51 to 2.54; eight trials, 3516 participants), pharmacotherapies (OR 1.98, 95% CI 1.26 to 3.11; five trials, 1092 participants), and multiple intervention programmes aimed mainly or solely at smoking cessation (OR 1.55, 95% CI 1.13 to 2.13; six trials, 5018 participants) all increased cessation rates in comparison to no treatment or minimal intervention controls. Self‐help materials were less effective (OR 1.16, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.82; six trials, 1906 participants), and two relapse prevention programmes (484 participants) did not help to sustain long‐term abstinence. Incentives did not appear to improve the odds of quitting, apart from one study which found a sustained positive benefit. There was a lack of evidence that comprehensive programmes targeting multiple risk factors reduced the prevalence of smoking. Authors' conclusions 1. We found strong evidence that some interventions directed towards individual smokers increase the likelihood of quitting smoking. These include individual and group counselling, pharmacological treatment to overcome nicotine addiction, and multiple interventions targeting smoking cessation as the primary or only outcome. All these interventions show similar effects whether offered in the workplace or elsewhere. Self‐help interventions and social support are less effective. Although people taking up these interventions are more likely to stop, the absolute numbers who quit are low. 2. We failed to detect an effect of comprehensive programmes targeting multiple risk factors in reducing the prevalence of smoking, although this finding was not based on meta‐analysed data.    3. There was limited evidence that participation in programmes can be increased by competitions and incentives organized by the employer, although one trial demonstrated a sustained effect of financial rewards for attending a smoking cessation course and for long‐term quitting. Further research is needed to establish which components of this trial contributed to the improvement in success rates. 4. Further research would be valuable in low‐income and developing countries, where high rates of smoking prevail and smoke‐free legislation is not widely accepted or enforced. Plain language summary Is the workplace an effective setting for helping people to stop smoking Background   The workplace appears to be a useful setting for helping people to stop smoking. Large groups of smokers are available who can easily be reached and helped, using proven methods. It is also in the employers’ interests to improve the health of their workforce. Recent changes introducing anti‐smoking laws in many developed countries may have eased the pressure to demonstrate the value of work‐based programmes. The situation in developing countries still requires that such methods be tested and proved in those communities. We reviewed the evidence about workplace programmes to help employees stop smoking, and any information about their costs and benefits. Study characteristics   For this updated review (first published in 2003), we searched for randomized and quasi‐randomized controlled trials, comparing the success rates of those in a work‐based stop‐smoking programme with those not involved in a work‐based stop‐smoking programme. The comparison could be between people within a single worksite, or between one or more worksites randomized to a stop‐smoking programme or to no programme (cluster‐randomized). The study had to include adults (over 18), and could be in any language and reported in any format, published or not. It had to report the numbers stopping smoking for at least six months. Results   We searched for studies in July 2013, and identified ten new trials that fitted our criteria, making a total for this update of 61 comparisons across 57 included studies. We grouped them into two broad categories: those aimed at helping individual smokers, and those that targeted the workplace environment as a whole. The first group includes such methods as individual or group counselling, self help, nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) and other medications, help from workmates or other staff, and helping quitters to stay smoke‐free. The second group includes environmental cues (posters, reminders), financial or material incentives, and comprehensive smoking cessation or health promotion programmes. The review found that programmes based on group behaviour therapy (eight trials; 1309 participants), on individual counselling (eight trials; 3516 participants), on medications (five trials; 1092 participants), and on several interventions combined (six trials; 5018 participants) helped people to stop smoking. The chances of stopping smoking using these methods are about the same in the workplace as they are in other settings. This review found that the following do not help people to stop smoking when delivered in the workplace: self‐help methods, support from friends, family and workmates, relapse prevention programmes, environmental cues, or comprehensive programmes aimed at changing several high‐risk behaviours. Results were mixed for incentives, with one high‐quality trial finding a clear benefit for incentives while the remaining five did not. Quality of the evidence   Earlier studies tended to be less well‐conducted and reported than recent ones. Fewer than one in five studies randomized their study population by an acceptable method. Two‐thirds of the studies checked the accuracy of those who said they had quit by testing their breath, blood or urine. The results were generally in line with findings from other reviews of those ways of quitting in any setting. The 'Summary of findings' table shows that the trials were generally rated as being of moderate to high quality, further confirming the strength of our findings. Future research might examine what features of the large incentives trial made it more successful than other trials in that group. It would also be helpful to have more trials from developing and low‐income countries, where smoking rates remain high and anti‐smoking laws are not widely enforced.","2","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Smoking Prevention; *Workplace; Counseling; Humans; Psychotherapy, Group; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Smoking Cessation [*methods]; Social Support; Tobacco Use Cessation Devices","10.1002/14651858.CD003440.pub4","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD003440.pub4","Tobacco Addiction"
