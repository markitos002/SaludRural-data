CD009405.PUB2,"Horvat, L; Horey, D; Romios, P; Kis‐Rigo, J",Cultural competence education for health professionals,Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews,2014,"Abstract - Background Cultural competence education for health professionals aims to ensure all people receive equitable, effective health care, particularly those from culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) backgrounds. It has emerged as a strategy in high‐income English‐speaking countries in response to evidence of health disparities, structural inequalities, and poorer quality health care and outcomes among people from minority CALD backgrounds. However there is a paucity of evidence to link cultural competence education with patient, professional and organisational outcomes. To assess efficacy, for this review we developed a four‐dimensional conceptual framework comprising educational content, pedagogical approach, structure of the intervention, and participant characteristics to provide consistency in describing and assessing interventions. We use the term 'CALD participants' when referring to minority CALD populations as a whole. When referring to participants in included studies we describe them in terms used by study authors. Objectives To assess the effects of cultural competence education interventions for health professionals on patient‐related outcomes, health professional outcomes, and healthcare organisation outcomes. Search methods We searched: MEDLINE (OvidSP) (1946 to June 2012); Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL,  The Cochrane Library ) (June 2012); EMBASE (OvidSP) (1988 to June 2012); CINAHL (EbscoHOST) (1981 to June 2012); PsycINFO (OvidSP) (1806 to June 2012); Proquest Dissertations and Theses database (1861 to October 2011); ERIC (CSA) (1966 to October 2011); LILACS (1982 to March 2012); and Current Contents (OvidSP) (1993 Week 27 to June 2012). Searches in MEDLINE, CENTRAL, PsycINFO, EMBASE, Proquest Dissertations and Theses, ERIC and Current Contents were updated in February 2014. Searches in CINAHL were updated in March 2014. There were no language restrictions. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster RCTs, and controlled clinical trials of educational interventions for health professionals working in health settings that aimed to improve: health outcomes of patients/consumers of minority cultural and linguistic backgrounds; knowledge, skills and attitudes of health professionals in delivering culturally competent care; and healthcare organisation performance in culturally competent care. Data collection and analysis We used the conceptual framework as the basis for data extraction. Two review authors independently extracted data on interventions, methods, and outcome measures and mapped them against the framework. Additional information was sought from study authors. We present results in narrative and tabular form. Main results We included five RCTs involving 337 healthcare professionals and 8400 patients; at least 3463 (41%) were from CALD backgrounds. Trials compared the effects of cultural competence training for health professionals, with no training. Three studies were from the USA, one from Canada and one from The Netherlands. They involved health professionals of diverse backgrounds, although most were not from CALD minorities. Cultural background was determined using a validated scale (one study), self‐report (two studies) or not reported (two studies). The design effect from clustering meant an effective minimum sample size of 3164 CALD participants. No meta‐analyses were performed. The quality of evidence for each outcome was judged to be low. Two trials comparing cultural competence training with no training found no evidence of effect for treatment outcomes, including the proportion of patients with diabetes achieving LDL cholesterol control targets (risk difference (RD) ‐0.02, 95% CI ‐0.06 to 0.02; 1 study, USA, 2699 ""black"" patients, moderate quality), or change in weight loss (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.07, 95% CI ‐0.41 to 0.55, 1 study, USA, effective sample size (ESS) 68 patients, low quality). Health behaviour (client concordance with attendance) improved significantly among intervention participants compared with controls (relative risk (RR) 1.53, 95% CI 1.03 to 2.27, 1 study, USA, ESS 28 women, low quality). Involvement in care by ""non‐Western"" patients (described as ""mainly Turkish, Moroccan, Cape Verdean and Surinamese patients"") with largely ""Western"" doctors improved in terms of mutual understanding (SMD 0.21, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.42, 1 study, The Netherlands, 109 patients, low quality). Evaluations of care were mixed (three studies). Two studies found no evidence of effect in: proportion of patients reporting satisfaction with consultations (RD 0.14, 95% CI ‐0.03 to 0.31, 1 study, The Netherlands, 109 patients, low quality); patient scores of physician cultural competency (SMD 0.11 95% CI ‐0.63 to 0.85, 1 study, USA, ESS 68 ""Caucasian"" and ""non‐Causcasian"" patients (described as Latino, African American, Asian and other, low quality). Client perceptions of health professionals were significantly higher in the intervention group (SMD 1.60 95% CI 1.05 to 2.15, 1 study, USA, ESS 28 ""Black"" women, low quality). No study assessed adverse outcomes. There was no evidence of effect on clinician awareness of ""racial"" differences in quality of care among clients at a USA health centre (RR 1.37, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.94. P = 0.07) with no adjustment for clustering. Included studies did not measure other outcomes of interest. Sensitivity analyses using different values for the Intra‐cluster coefficient (ICC) did not substantially alter the magnitude or significance of summary effect sizes. All four domains of the conceptual framework were addressed, suggesting agreement on core components of cultural competence education interventions may be possible. Authors' conclusions Cultural competence continues to be developed as a major strategy to address health inequities. Five studies assessed the effects of cultural competence education for health professionals on patient‐related outcomes. There was positive, albeit low‐quality evidence, showing improvements in the involvement of CALD patients. Findings either showed support for the educational interventions or no evidence of effect. No studies assessed adverse outcomes. The quality of evidence is insufficient to draw generalisable conclusions, largely due to heterogeneity of the interventions in content, scope, design, duration, implementation and outcomes selected. Further research is required to establish greater methodological rigour and uniformity on core components of education interventions, including how they are described and evaluated. Our conceptual framework provides a basis for establishing consensus to improve reporting and allow assessment across studies and populations. Future studies should measure the patient outcomes used: treatment outcomes; health behaviours; involvement in care and evaluations of care. Studies should also measure the impact of these types of interventions on healthcare organisations, as these are likely to affect uptake and sustainability. Plain language summary Cultural competence education for health professionals This review assessed the effects of cultural competence education for health professionals. Five studies were included involving 337 health professionals (including general practitioners, primary care teams and counsellors) and 8400 patients. Three studies were conducted in the USA, one in Canada and one in The Netherlands. At least 3000 patients were from culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) backgrounds and some of the health professional groups were also from CALD backgrounds. Due to differences in terminology and their cultural meanings, and the evolving nature of concepts and practices in this area, in this review we use the term 'CALD participants' when referring to minority, CALD populations as a whole. When referring to participants in included studies we describe them in the terms used by the relevant study authors. The studies differed in how the education was provided and which outcome measures were used. Involvement in care improved in one study in The Netherlands measuring mutual understanding between minority CALD background patients and their doctors. Health behaviour also changed in one small study in the USA, in which women whose counsellors had received education were three times more likely to attend planned counselling sessions. However there was no evidence of an effect on a range of treatment outcomes or evaluations of care. None of the five included studies examined the effect of cultural competence education on healthcare organisations, or assessed adverse outcomes. The review findings showed some support for cultural competence education for health professionals. These findings are tentative, however, as the quality of the evidence was low and more data are needed. Future research on cultural competence education for health professionals should seek greater consensus on the core components of cultural competence education, how participants are described and the outcomes assessed.",5,"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",1465-1858,Canada; Cultural Competency [*education]; Cultural Diversity; Health Personnel [*education]; Healthcare Disparities; Humans; Minority Groups; Netherlands; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; United States,10.1002/14651858.CD009405.pub2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD009405.pub2,Consumers and Communication
CD011429.PUB2,"Carr, PJ; Higgins, NS; Cooke, ML; Mihala, G; Rickard, CM",Vascular access specialist teams for device insertion and prevention of failure,Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews,2018,"Abstract - Background Most people admitted to hospitals worldwide require a vascular access device (VAD). Hundreds of millions of VADs are inserted annually in the USA with reports of over a billion peripheral intravenous catheters used annually worldwide. Numerous reports suggest that a team approach for the assessment, insertion, and maintenance of VADs improves clinical outcomes, the patient experience, and healthcare processes. Objectives To compare the use of the vascular access specialist team (VAST) for VAD insertion and care to a generalist model approach for hospital or community participants requiring a VAD in terms of insertion success, device failure, and cost‐effectiveness. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2018, Issue 1); Ovid MEDLINE (1950 to 7 February 2018); Ovid Embase (1980 to 7 February 2018); EBSCO CINAHL (1982 to 7 February 2018); Web of Science Conference Proceedings Citation Index ‐ Science and Social Science and Humanities (1990 to 7 February 2018); and Google Scholar. We searched the following trial registries: Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Register ( www.anzctr.org.au ); ClinicalTrials.gov ( www.clinicaltrials.gov ); Current Controlled Trials ( www.controlled‐trials.com/mrct ); HKU Clinical Trials Registry ( www.hkclinicaltrials.com ); Clinical Trials Registry ‐ India ( ctri.nic.in/Clinicaltrials/login.php ); UK Clinical Trials Gateway ( www.controlled‐trials.com/ukctr/ ); and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) ( www.who.int/trialsearch ). We searched all databases on 7 February 2018. Selection criteria We planned to include randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated the effectiveness of VAST or specialist inserters for their impact on clinical outcomes. Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological procedures recommended by Cochrane and used Covidence software to assist with file management. Main results We retrieved 2398 citations: 30 studies were eligible for further examination of their full text, and we found one registered clinical trial in progress. No studies could be included in the analysis or review. We assigned one study as awaiting classification, as it has not been accepted for publication. Authors' conclusions This systematic review failed to locate relevant published RCTs to support or refute the assertion that vascular access specialist teams are superior to the generalist model. A vascular access specialist team has advanced knowledge with regard to insertion techniques, clinical care, and management of vascular access devices, whereas a generalist model comprises nurses, doctors, or other designated healthcare professionals in the healthcare facility who may have less advanced insertion techniques and who care for vascular access devices amongst other competing clinical tasks. However, this conclusion may change once the one study awaiting classification and one ongoing study are published. There is a need for good‐quality RCTs to evaluate the efficacy of a vascular access specialist team approach for vascular access device insertion and care for the prevention of failure. Plain language summary Vascular access specialist teams for insertion of and prevention of vascular access device failure Review question We reviewed the evidence concerning the effectiveness of vascular access specialist teams (VAST) compared with generalist models in terms of vascular access device insertion success, device failure, and cost‐effectiveness. We did not find any eligible studies for our review. Background We describe a VAST as the grouping of healthcare personnel who have advanced knowledge and skills in the assessment, insertion, care, and management of vascular access devices, such as infusion/intravenous, intravenous therapy teams, as well as individual vascular access specialists (nurse, doctor, therapist, technician, and physician assistant). Our goal was to evaluate if the VAST approach is superior to a generalist approach. We define a generalist model or approach as a larger groups of nurses, doctors, or other designated healthcare professionals in the healthcare facility who have less advanced skills and knowledge in inserting and managing vascular access devices. We define a vascular access device (VAD) as a catheter (thin tube) inserted into veins or ports that can be implanted under the skin, allowing fluids and medicines to be delivered into veins. Catheters inserted into arteries can be used to monitor therapy. The most common VAD, the peripheral intravenous catheter (PIVC), may remain in place for many days before removal. Implanted VADs or catheters in central veins can usually remain for many weeks, months, and in some cases, particularly with ports, years. Vascular access devices are used for giving fluids (infusion therapy) and intravenous (injected into a vein) medicines, taking blood samples, and invasive monitoring, and are often crucial in providing treatment and care. The use of VADs and infusion therapy extends across almost all medical, surgical, and critical care specialties, and occurs in hospital, long‐term care, and home care settings. There are several risks related to the insertion of a VAD and its ongoing care that can cause the device to fail (to become no longer suitable for care). One significant postinsertion complication includes catheter‐related venous thrombosis (clot formation). People with cancer or who are critically ill and may require additional medical interventions to treat thrombosis are particularly at risk for this complication. A risk of infusion‐related inflammation of the vein (phlebitis or thrombophlebitis) exists for the PIVC when the cannulated vein becomes painful with other potential signs such as a red appearance at the insertion site. Infection risks such as catheter‐related bloodstream infections are associated with all VADs; preventing such occurrences is a healthcare priority. Catheter‐related bloodstream infections are associated with longer hospital stay, serious illness, death, and increased health service costs. Study characteristics We searched a wide range of medical databases on 7 February 2018. We identified 2398 potential studies, 30 of which we looked at in detail. We found one suitable study, however although the study is complete the manuscript has not yet been accepted for publication, and so we were unable to analyse the data. We have assigned the study as awaiting classification; once its results are published we will evaluate it again and decide if it is eligible for inclusion in the review. We found one registered trial that is investigating our review question, but it is still ongoing and not yet completed or published. Key results We failed to locate any published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to support or refute the assertion that vascular access specialist teams are superior to the generalist model for device insertion and prevention of failure. However, this conclusion may change once the one study awaiting classification and the one ongoing study are published. There is a need for good‐quality RCTs to evaluate the efficacy of a VAST approach for VAD insertion and prevention of failure. An RCT is a study (or trial) that aims to reduce bias when testing a new treatment. The people taking part in the trial are randomly allocated to either the group receiving the treatment under investigation or to a group receiving standard treatment (or placebo treatment) as the control. Quality of evidence We did not analyse the quality of the evidence as we did not find any suitable studies to include in our review.",3,"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",1465-1858,*Cardiology; *Vascular Access Devices; Humans; Workforce,10.1002/14651858.CD011429.pub2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD011429.pub2,Emergency and Critical Care
CD012876.PUB2,"Xyrichis, A; Iliopoulou, K; Mackintosh, NJ; Bench, S; Terblanche, M; Philippou, J; Sandall, J",Healthcare stakeholders’ perceptions and experiences of factors affecting the implementation of critical care telemedicine (CCT): qualitative evidence synthesis,Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews,2021,"Abstract - Background Critical care telemedicine (CCT) has long been advocated for enabling access to scarce critical care expertise in geographically‐distant areas. Additional advantages of CCT include the potential for reduced variability in treatment and care through clinical decision support enabled by the analysis of large data sets and the use of predictive tools. Evidence points to health systems investing in telemedicine appearing better prepared to respond to sudden increases in demand, such as during pandemics. However, challenges with how new technologies such as CCT are implemented still remain, and must be carefully considered. Objectives This synthesis links to and complements another Cochrane Review assessing the effects of interactive telemedicine in healthcare, by examining the implementation of telemedicine specifically in critical care. Our aim was to identify, appraise and synthesise qualitative research evidence on healthcare stakeholders’ perceptions and experiences of factors affecting the implementation of CCT, and to identify factors that are more likely to ensure successful implementation of CCT for subsequent consideration and assessment in telemedicine effectiveness reviews. Search methods We searched MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and Web of Science for eligible studies from inception to 14 October 2019; alongside 'grey' and other literature searches. There were no language, date or geographic restrictions. Selection criteria We included studies that used qualitative methods for data collection and analysis. Studies included views from healthcare stakeholders including bedside and CCT hub critical care personnel, as well as administrative, technical, information technology, and managerial staff, and family members. Data collection and analysis We extracted data using a predetermined extraction sheet. We used the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) qualitative checklist to assess the methodological rigour of individual studies. We followed the Best‐fit framework approach using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) to inform our data synthesis.  We classified additional themes not captured by CFIR under a separate theme. We used the GRADE CERQual approach to assess confidence in the findings. Main results We found 13 relevant studies. Twelve were from the USA and one was from Canada. Where we judged the North American focus of the studies to be a concern for a finding’s relevance, we have reflected this in our assessment of confidence in the finding. The studies explored the views and experiences of bedside and hub critical care personnel; administrative, technical, information technology, and managerial staff; and family members. The intensive care units (ICUs) were from tertiary hospitals in urban and rural areas. We identified several factors that could influence the implementation of CCT. We had high confidence in the following findings: Hospital staff and family members described several advantages of CCT.  Bedside and hub staff strongly believed that the main advantage of CCT was having access to experts when bedside physicians were not available. Families also valued having access to critical care experts. In addition, hospital staff described how CCT could support clinical decision‐making and mentoring of junior staff.  Hospital staff greatly valued the nature and quality of social networks between the bedside and CCT hub teams . Key issues for them were trust, acceptance, teamness, familiarity and effective communication between the two teams. Interactions between some bedside and CCT hub staff were featured with tension, frustration and conflict.  Staff on both sides commonly described disrespect of their expertise, resistance and animosity. Hospital staff thought it was important to promote and offer training in the use of CCT before its implementation.  This included rehearsing every step in the process, offering staff opportunities to ask questions and disseminating learning resources. Some also complained that experienced staff were taken away from bedside care and re‐allocated to the CCT hub team. Hospital staff's attitudes towards, knowledge about and value placed on CCT influenced acceptance of CCT.  Staff were positive towards CCT because of its several advantages. But some were concerned that the CCT hub staff were not able to understand the patient’s situation through the camera. Some were also concerned about confidentiality of patient data. We also identified other factors that could influence the implementation of CCT, although our confidence in these findings is moderate or low. These factors included the extent to which telemedicine software was adaptable to local needs, and hub staff were aware of local norms; concerns about additional administrative work and cost; patients' and families’ desire to stay close to their local community; the type of hospital setting; the extent to which there was support from senior leadership; staff access to information about policies and procedures; individuals' stage of change; staff motivation, competence and values; clear strategies for staff engagement; feedback about progress; and the impact of CCT on staffing levels. Authors' conclusions Our review identified several factors that could influence the acceptance and use of telemedicine in critical care. These include the value that hospital staff and family members place on having access to critical care experts, staff access to sufficient training, and the extent to which healthcare providers at the bedside and the critical care experts supporting them from a distance acknowledge and respect each other’s expertise. Further research, especially in contexts other than North America, with different cultures, norms and practices will strengthen the evidence base for the implementation of CCT internationally and our confidence in these findings. Implementation of CCT appears to be growing in importance in the context of global pandemic management, especially in countries with wide geographical dispersion and limited access to critical care expertise. For successful implementation, policymakers and other stakeholders should consider pre‐empting and addressing factors that may affect implementation, including strengthening teamness between bedside and hub teams; engaging and supporting frontline staff; training ICU clinicians on the use of CCT prior to its implementation; and ensuring staff have access to information and knowledge about when, why and how to use CCT for maximum benefit. Plain language summary What are healthcare stakeholders’ perceptions and experiences of factors affecting the implementation of critical care telemedicine? What is the aim of this review? The aim of this review was to identify factors that affect the acceptance and use of health care from a distance (known as telemedicine) for patients in intensive care units (also known as critical care). To answer this question, we searched for and analysed qualitative studies about the perceptions and experiences of clinical staff, managers and administrators, as well as patients and family members. This review links to another Cochrane Review assessing the effects of telemedicine.  Key messages Our review identified several factors that could influence the acceptance and use of telemedicine in critical care. These included the value that hospital staff and family members place on having access to critical care experts, staff access to sufficient training, and the extent to which healthcare providers at the bedside and the critical care experts supporting them from a distance acknowledge and respect each other’s expertise. What was studied in this synthesis? In critical care telemedicine (CCT), patients in intensive care units (ICUs) are monitored by critical care experts based at a ‘hub’ outside the hospital. By monitoring patients, hub staff are able to warn staff at the bedside of potential problems and offer them decision support. The use of CCT means that patients and staff in rural or small hospitals have access to critical care experts. But there may still be challenges when implementing CCT. In this review, we assessed studies that looked at the perceptions and experiences of healthcare workers, family members and others to find factors that could influence the acceptance and use of CCT. What are the main findings of the synthesis? We included 13 relevant studies. Twelve were from the USA and one was from Canada. Where we judged the North American focus of the studies to be a concern for a finding’s relevance, we have reflected this in our assessment of confidence in the finding. The studies explored the views and experiences of bedside and hub critical care personnel; administrative, technical, information technology, and managerial staff, and family members. The ICUs were from hospitals in both urban and rural areas. We identified several factors that could influence the acceptance and use of CCT. We had high confidence in the following findings: Hospital staff and family members described several advantages of CCT.

CD011242.PUB2,"Barnard, S; Kim, C; Park, MH; Ngo, TD",Doctors or mid‐level providers for abortion,Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews,2015,"Abstract - Background The World Health Organization recommends that abortion can be provided at the lowest level of the healthcare system. Training mid‐level providers, such as midwives, nurses and other non‐physician providers, to conduct first trimester aspiration abortions and manage medical abortions has been proposed as a way to increase women's access to safe abortion procedures. Objectives To assess the safety and effectiveness of abortion procedures administered by mid‐level providers compared to doctors. Search methods We searched the CENTRAL Issue 7, MEDLINE and POPLINE databases for comparative studies of doctor and mid‐level providers of abortion services. We searched for studies published in any language from January 1980 until 15 August 2014. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) (clustered or not clustered), prospective cohort studies or observational studies that compared the safety or effectiveness (or both) of any type of first trimester abortion procedure, administered by any type of mid‐level provider or doctors, were eligible for inclusion in the review. Data collection and analysis Two independent review authors screened abstracts for eligibility and double‐extracted data from the included studies using a pre‐tested form. We meta‐analysed primary outcome data using both fixed‐effect and random‐effects models to obtain pooled risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We carried out separate analyses by study design (RCT or cohort) and type of abortion procedure (medical versus surgical). Main results Eight studies involving 22,018 participants met our eligibility criteria. Five studies (n = 18,962) assessed the safety and effectiveness of surgical abortion procedures administered by mid‐level providers compared to doctors. Three studies (n = 3056) assessed the safety and effectiveness of medical abortion procedures. The surgical abortion studies (one RCT and four cohort studies) were carried out in the United States, India, South Africa and Vietnam. The medical abortion studies (two RCTs and one cohort study) were carried out in India, Sweden and Nepal. The studies included women with gestational ages up to 14 weeks for surgical abortion and nine weeks for medical abortion. Risk of selection bias was considered to be low in the three RCTs, unclear in four observational studies and high in one observational study. Concealment bias was considered to be low in the three RCTs and high in all five observational studies. Although none of the eight studies performed blinding of the participants to the provider type, we considered the performance bias to be low as this is part of the intervention. Detection bias was considered to be high in all eight studies as none of the eight studies preformed blinding of the outcome assessment. Attrition bias was low in seven studies and high in one, with over 20% attrition. We considered six studies to have unclear risk of selective reporting bias as their protocols had not been published. The remaining two studies had published their protocols. Few other sources of bias were found. Based on an analysis of three cohort studies, the risk of surgical abortion failure was significantly higher when provided by mid‐level providers than when procedures were administered by doctors (RR 2.25, 95% CI 1.38 to 3.68) ,  however the quality of evidence for this outcome was deemed to be very low. For surgical abortion procedures, we found no significant differences in the risk of complications between mid‐level providers and doctors (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.17 to 5.70 from RCTs; RR 1.38, 95% CI 0.70 to 2.72 from observational studies). When we combined the data for failure and complications for surgical abortion we found no significant differences between mid‐level providers and doctors in both the observational study analysis (RR 1.36, 95% CI 0.86 to 2.14) and the RCT analysis (RR 3.07, 95% CI 0.16 to 59.08). The quality of evidence of the outcome for RCT studies was considered to be low and for observational studies very low. For medical abortion procedures the risk of failure was not different for mid‐level providers or doctors (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.36 from RCTs; RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.88 from observational studies). The quality of evidence of this outcome for the RCT analysis was considered to be high, although the quality of evidence of the observational studies was considered to be very low. There were no complications reported in the three medical abortion studies. Authors' conclusions There was no statistically significant difference in the risk of failure for medical abortions performed by mid‐level providers compared with doctors. Observational data indicate that there may be a higher risk of abortion failure for surgical abortion procedures administered by mid‐level providers, but the number of studies is small and more robust data from controlled trials are needed. There were no statistically significant differences in the risk of complications for first trimester surgical abortions performed by mid‐level providers compared with doctors. Plain language summary Can health care providers who are not doctors perform abortions as well as doctors? Unsafe abortion causes death and disability and remains a major public health concern in developing countries. Most of these deaths and disabilities could be prevented if safe and legal abortion were provided by trained people. This review looked at whether using mid‐level providers (health care providers who are not doctors) to perform abortions is safe. It also looked at whether the abortions provided by mid‐level providers worked as well as those provided by doctors. We carried out searches for studies that compared medical abortion (using pills) or surgical abortion provided by either mid‐level providers or doctors. We also wrote to researchers to find more studies. The studies could compare how safe the abortions were or how effective they were (whether they actually worked).  T he evidence we found is up to date as of the 15 th  of August 2014. We found eight studies with a total of 22,018 participants. Five studies compared surgical abortion provided by doctors or mid‐level providers and three studies compared medical abortion provided by doctors or mid‐level providers. Of the five surgical abortion studies only one had a high‐quality study design. Of the three medical abortion studies, two had a high‐quality study design. Three of these studies were carried out in America, two in India, one in was carried out in both South Africa and Vietnam the remaining two were from Sweden and Nepal. The results from the analyses of the medical abortion studies showed that there does not seem to be an advantage when these are provided by doctors. The results from most of the analyses of the surgical abortion studies showed that we cannot be sure that there is a difference in how safe and how effective mid‐level providers are compared to doctors. One analysis of three low‐quality studies of surgical abortion showed that there was more chance of the abortion being ineffective if it was provided by mid‐level providers. Most of the studies did not show a difference between mid‐level providers and doctors in how safe the abortions were and how well they worked. Training mid‐level providers to give medical or surgical abortions could reduce the number of deaths and the disability caused by unsafe abortion.

Reminders may help clinicians overcome these problems by prompting them to recall information that they already know or would be expected to know and by providing information or guidance in a more accessible and relevant format, at a particularly appropriate time. This is an update of a previously published review. Objectives To evaluate the effects of reminders automatically generated through a computerized system (computer‐generated) and delivered on paper to healthcare professionals on quality of care (outcomes related to healthcare professionals' practice) and patient outcomes (outcomes related to patients' health condition). Search methods We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, six other databases and two trials registers up to 21 September 2016 together with reference checking, citation searching and contact with study authors to identify additional studies. Selection criteria We included individual‐ or cluster‐randomized and non‐randomized trials that evaluated the impact of computer‐generated reminders delivered on paper to healthcare professionals, alone (single‐component intervention) or in addition to one or more co‐interventions (multi‐component intervention), compared with usual care or the co‐intervention(s) without the reminder component. Data collection and analysis Review authors working in pairs independently screened studies for eligibility and abstracted data. For each study, we extracted the primary outcome when it was defined or calculated the median effect size across all reported outcomes. We then calculated the median improvement and interquartile range (IQR) across included studies using the primary outcome or median outcome as representative outcome. We assessed the certainty of the evidence according to the GRADE approach. Main results We identified 35 studies (30 randomized trials and five non‐randomized trials) and analyzed 34 studies (40 comparisons). Twenty‐nine studies took place in the USA and six studies took place in Canada, France, Israel, and Kenya. All studies except two took place in outpatient care. Reminders were aimed at enhancing compliance with preventive guidelines (e.g. cancer screening tests, vaccination) in half the studies and at enhancing compliance with disease management guidelines for acute or chronic conditions (e.g. annual follow‐ups, laboratory tests, medication adjustment, counseling) in the other half. Computer‐generated reminders delivered on paper to healthcare professionals, alone or in addition to co‐intervention(s), probably improves quality of care slightly compared with usual care or the co‐intervention(s) without the reminder component (median improvement 6.8% (IQR: 3.8% to 17.5%); 34 studies (40 comparisons); moderate‐certainty evidence). Computer‐generated reminders delivered on paper to healthcare professionals alone (single‐component intervention) probably improves quality of care compared with usual care (median improvement 11.0% (IQR 5.4% to 20.0%); 27 studies (27 comparisons); moderate‐certainty evidence). Adding computer‐generated reminders delivered on paper to healthcare professionals to one or more co‐interventions (multi‐component intervention) probably improves quality of care slightly compared with the co‐intervention(s) without the reminder component (median improvement 4.0% (IQR 3.0% to 6.0%); 11 studies (13 comparisons); moderate‐certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether reminders, alone or in addition to co‐intervention(s), improve patient outcomes as the certainty of the evidence is very low (n = 6 studies (seven comparisons)). None of the included studies reported outcomes related to harms or adverse effects of the intervention. Authors' conclusions There is moderate‐certainty evidence that computer‐generated reminders delivered on paper to healthcare professionals probably slightly improves quality of care, in terms of compliance with preventive guidelines and compliance with disease management guidelines. It is uncertain whether reminders improve patient outcomes because the certainty of the evidence is very low. The heterogeneity of the reminder interventions included in this review also suggests that reminders can probably improve quality of care in various settings under various conditions. Plain language summary The effect of automatically generated reminders delivered to providers on paper on quality of care and patient outcomes What is the aim of this review? The aim of this Cochrane review was to find out if reminders, automatically generated through a computer, but delivered on paper to doctors help them provide the best recommended care. Cochrane researchers identified 35 studies and analyzed 34 of these studies to answer this question. Key messages Providing reminders to doctors probably improves slightly the quality of care patients receive. However, because the certainty of the evidence is moderate, more high‐quality studies on the effectiveness of reminders are needed to confirm to findings of this review. What was studied in the review? Doctors do not always provide care that is recommended or that reflects the latest research, partly because of too much information or inaccessible information. Reminders may help doctors overcome these problems by reminding them about guidelines and research findings, or by providing advice, in a more accessible and relevant format, at a particularly appropriate time. For example, when a doctor sees a patient for an annual check‐up, the doctor would receive the patient's chart with a reminder section listing the screening tests due that year, such as colorectal cancer screening. In this review, we evaluated the effects of reminders on the quality of care delivered by physicians, on patient outcomes, and on adverse effects. These reminders were automatically generated through a computer system but delivered on paper. What are the main results of the review? Twenty‐nine studies were from the USA and six studies were from Canada, France, Israel and Kenya. The studies examined reminders to doctors to order screening tests, to provide vaccinations, to prescribe specific medications, or to discuss care with patients. The review shows that: ‐ overall, reminders probably improve slightly quality of care by 6.8% (in 34 studies (40 comparisons), moderate‐certainty evidence); ‐ reminders alone (single‐component intervention) probably improve quality of care by 11.0% compared with usual care (in 27 studies (27 comparisons), moderate‐certainty evidence); ‐ adding reminders to one or more co‐interventions (multi‐component intervention) probably improve slightly quality of care by 4.0% compared with the co‐intervention(s) without the reminder component (in 11 studies (13 comparisons), moderate‐certainty evidence); ‐ it is uncertain whether reminders improve patient outcomes because the certainty of the evidence is very low; ‐ none of the included studies reported outcomes related to harms or adverse effects.

With high expectations for healthcare providers to remain up‐to‐date with current evidence and the movement towards formalizing reflective practice as part of physician revalidation, it is important that curricula developed for improving the ability to formulate well‐constructed questions are based on the best evidence. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of interventions for increasing the frequency and quality of questions formulated by healthcare providers in practice and the context of self‐directed learning. Search methods We obtained studies from searches of electronic bibliographic databases, and supplemented these with handsearching, checking reference lists, and consultation with experts. Selection criteria We considered published and unpublished randomized controlled trials (RCTs), controlled clinical trials (CCTs), interrupted time‐series (ITS), and controlled before‐after (CBA) studies of any language examining interventions for increasing the quality and frequency of questions formulated by health professionals involved with direct patient care. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently undertook all relevancy screening and 'Risk of bias' assessment in duplicate. Intervention characteristics, follow‐up intervals, and measurement outcomes were diverse and precluded quantitative analysis. We have summarized data descriptively. Main results Searches identified four studies examining interventions to improve question formulation in healthcare professionals. Interventions were mostly multi‐component, limited within the context of EBM and primarily in physician and resident populations. We did not identify studies examining changes in frequency of questions formulated or those within the context of reflection. Risk of bias was generally rated to be ‘high risk’. Three of the four studies showed improvements in question formulation in physicians, residents, or mixed allied health populations in the short‐ to moderate term follow up. Only one study examined sustainability of effects at one year and reported that skills had eroded over time. Authors' conclusions Evidence from our review suggests that interventions to increase the quality of questions formulated in practice produce mixed results at both short‐ (immediately following intervention), and moderate‐term follow up (up to nine months), comparatively. Although three studies reported effectiveness estimates of an educational intervention for increasing the quality of question formulation within the short term, only one study examined the effectiveness in the longer term (one year) and revealed that search skills had eroded over time. Data suggests that sustainability of effects from educational interventions for question formulation are unknown. Plain language summary Interventions to improve question formulation in professional practice and self‐directed learning Health professionals ask questions as part of their daily practice lives. They can ask questions for a number of reasons including whether or not their knowledge is current (e.g. 'what is the best drug to use for this disease') or to reflect on whether or not they have made the best decision (e.g. 'is there anything else I could have done differently to improve this patient's care?'). We know less about how to increase the number of questions they ask and how to increase the quality of the questions they ask. Questions, and how they are structured, can have an important impact on how healthcare professionals search for information, speak with colleagues, and learn in practice. Health professionals are doctors, nurses, physiotherapists, pharmacists, occupational therapists, and anyone who provides direct patient care. This review shows that there were some small improvements in the quality of questions created by healthcare professionals following some training (and in some cases the use of informational pamphlets), but we are uncertain how long these improvements last over time. With so little information we cannot make specific, or concrete, conclusions. We did not find information that would tell us what interventions are effective for increasing the number of questions asked and we suggest that this should be an area of research in the future.",5,"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",1465-1858,"*Professional Practice; Clinical Competence; Education, Continuing; Evidence-Based Medicine [*education]; Health Personnel [*education]; Humans; Problem-Based Learning [*methods, standards]; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic",10.1002/14651858.CD007335.pub2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD007335.pub2,Effective Practice and Organisation of Care

Reminders help clinicians overcome these problems by prompting them to recall information that they already know, or by presenting information in a different and more accessible format. Manually‐generated reminders delivered on paper are defined as information given to the health professional with each patient or encounter, provided on paper, in which no computer is involved in the production or delivery of the reminder. Manually‐generated reminders delivered on paper are relatively cheap interventions, and are especially relevant in settings where electronic clinical records are not widely available and affordable. This review is one of three Cochrane Reviews focused on the effectiveness of reminders in health care. Objectives 1. To determine the effectiveness of manually‐generated reminders delivered on paper in changing professional practice and improving patient outcomes.  2. To explore whether a number of potential effect modifiers influence the effectiveness of manually‐generated reminders delivered on paper. Search methods We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and two trials registers on 5 December 2018. We searched grey literature, screened individual journals, conference proceedings and relevant systematic reviews, and reviewed reference lists and cited references of included studies. Selection criteria We included randomised and non‐randomised trials assessing the impact of manually‐generated reminders delivered on paper as a single intervention (compared with usual care) or added to one or more co‐interventions as a multicomponent intervention (compared with the co‐intervention(s) without the reminder component) on professional practice or patients' outcomes. We also included randomised and non‐randomised trials comparing manually‐generated reminders with other quality improvement (QI) interventions. Data collection and analysis Two review authors screened studies for eligibility and abstracted data independently. We extracted the primary outcome as defined by the authors or calculated the median effect size across all reported outcomes in each study. We then calculated the median percentage improvement and interquartile range across the included studies that reported improvement related outcomes, and assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. Main results We identified 63 studies (41 cluster‐randomised trials, 18 individual randomised trials, and four non‐randomised trials) that met all inclusion criteria. Fifty‐seven studies reported usable data (64 comparisons). The studies were mainly located in North America (42 studies) and the UK (eight studies). Fifty‐four studies took place in outpatient/ambulatory settings. The clinical areas most commonly targeted were cardiovascular disease management (11 studies), cancer screening (10 studies) and preventive care (10 studies), and most studies had physicians as their target population (57 studies). General management of a clinical condition (17 studies), test‐ordering (14 studies) and prescription (10 studies) were the behaviours more commonly targeted by the intervention. Forty‐eight studies reported changes in professional practice measured as dichotomous process adherence outcomes (e.g. compliance with guidelines recommendations), 16 reported those changes measured as continuous process‐of‐care outcomes (e.g. number of days with catheters), eight reported dichotomous patient outcomes (e.g. mortality rates) and five reported continuous patient outcomes (e.g. mean systolic blood pressure). Manually‐generated reminders delivered on paper probably improve professional practice measured as dichotomous process adherence outcomes) compared with usual care (median improvement 8.45% (IQR 2.54% to 20.58%); 39 comparisons, 40,346 participants; moderate certainty of evidence) and may make little or no difference to continuous process‐of‐care outcomes (8 comparisons, 3263 participants; low certainty of evidence). Adding manually‐generated paper reminders to one or more QI co‐interventions may slightly improve professional practice measured as dichotomous process adherence outcomes (median improvement 4.24% (IQR −1.09% to 5.50%); 12 comparisons, 25,359 participants; low certainty of evidence) and probably slightly improve professional practice measured as continuous outcomes (median improvement 0.28 (IQR 0.04 to 0.51); 2 comparisons, 12,372 participants; moderate certainty of evidence). Compared with other QI interventions, manually‐generated reminders may slightly decrease professional practice measured as process adherence outcomes (median decrease 7.9% (IQR −0.7% to 11%); 14 comparisons, 21,274 participants; low certainty of evidence). We are uncertain whether manually‐generated reminders delivered on paper, compared with usual care or with other QI intervention, lead to better or worse patient outcomes (dichotomous or continuous), as the certainty of the evidence is very low (10 studies, 13 comparisons). Reminders added to other QI interventions may make little or no difference to patient outcomes (dichotomous or continuous) compared with the QI alone (2 studies, 2 comparisons). Regarding resource use, studies reported additional costs per additional point of effectiveness gained, but because of the different currencies and years used the relevance of those figures is uncertain. None of the included studies reported outcomes related to harms or adverse effects. Authors' conclusions Manually‐generated reminders delivered on paper as a single intervention probably lead to small to moderate increases in outcomes related to adherence to clinical recommendations, and they could be used as a single QI intervention. It is uncertain whether reminders should be added to other QI intervention already in place in the health system, although the effects may be positive. If other QI interventions, such as patient or computerised reminders, are available, they should be preferred over manually‐generated reminders, but under close evaluation in order to decrease uncertainty about their potential effect. Plain language summary The effect of manually‐generated reminders delivered to providers on paper on professional practice and patient outcomes What is the aim of this review? In this Cochrane Review we aimed to find out if health workers who are given reminders on paper give better health care. The reminders contained information about the patients, for instance recommendation to measure blood pressure. We collected and analysed all relevant studies and found 63 studies. Key messages It seems likely that providing reminders to health workers probably leads to small‐to‐moderate improvements in their practice measured as adherence to clinical recommendations. It is uncertain whether providing reminders has an effect on patient outcomes. What was studied in the review? Health workers do not always provide care that is recommended by clinical guidelines or standards, because of too much information or unconscious forgetfulness. One possible solution is to give them paper reminders that were not created by a computer. These are particularly important in countries where electronic records are not widely available. Reminders may help health workers overcome those problems by prompting them to follow clinical recommendations in guidelines or by providing information in a simple and timely way. In this review we evaluated the effects of reminders generated manually and delivered on paper on professional practice and patient outcomes. What are the main results of the review? We identified 63 studies and included 57 in our analysis. The studies evaluated reminders aimed at ordering screening tests, providing vaccinations, prescribing specific medications, or discussing care with patients. The studies show that: ‐ reminders alone (single‐component intervention) probably improve professional practice, measured as compliance with recommendations, compared with usual care; ‐ reminders added to one or more co‐interventions (multicomponent intervention) may slightly improve professional practice, measured as compliance with recommendations, compared with the co‐intervention(s) without the reminder component; ‐ reminders may lead to slightly worse professional practice than other interventions for quality improvement, such as patients reminders; ‐ it is uncertain whether reminders compared with usual care or other quality‐improvement interventions improve patient outcomes; ‐ reminders added to other quality‐improvement interventions may make little or no difference to patient outcomes compared with the quality intervention alone; ‐ there were additional costs to obtain the effects described above, but the relevance of the figures presented was uncertain; ‐ none of the included studies reported outcomes related to harms or adverse effects.

Objectives To assess the effectiveness of interventions aimed at increasing the proportion of health professionals working in rural and other underserved areas. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, including specialised register of the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care Group; March 2014), MEDLINE (1966 to March 2014), EMBASE (1988 to March 2014), CINAHL (1982 to March 2014), LILACS (February 2014), Science Citation Index and Social Sciences Citation Index (up to April 2014), Global Health (March 2014) and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (June 2013). We also searched reference lists of all papers and relevant reviews identified, and contacted authors of relevant papers regarding any further published or unpublished work. Selection criteria Randomised trials, non‐randomised trials, controlled before‐and‐after studies and interrupted time series studies evaluating the effects of various interventions (e.g. educational, financial, regulatory or support strategies) on the recruitment or retention, or both, of health professionals in underserved areas. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently screened titles and abstracts and assessed full texts of potentially relevant studies for eligibility. Two review authors independently extracted data from eligible studies. Main results For this first update of the original review, we screened 8945 records for eligibility. We retrieved and assessed the full text of 125 studies. Only one study met the inclusion criteria of the review. This interrupted time series study, conducted in Taiwan, found that the implementation of a National Health Insurance scheme in 1995 was associated with improved equity in the geographic distribution of physicians and dentists. We judged the certainty of the evidence provided by this one study very low. Authors' conclusions There is currently limited reliable evidence regarding the effects of interventions aimed at addressing the inequitable distribution of health professionals. Well‐designed studies are needed to confirm or refute findings of observational studies of educational, financial, regulatory and supportive interventions that might influence healthcare professionals' decisions to practice in underserved areas. Governments and medical schools should ensure that when interventions are implemented, their impacts are evaluated using scientifically rigorous methods to establish the true effects of these measures on healthcare professional recruitment and retention in rural and other underserved settings. Plain language summary Interventions for increasing the proportion of health professionals practicing in rural and underserved areas What was the aim of this review? The aim of this Cochrane review was to find out whether strategies to increase the number of health professionals working in rural and underserved areas are effective. Researchers in The Cochrane Collaboration searched for all new studies that could answer this question, given that the previous review done in 2009 did not identify any high certainty evidence. What did the review conclude? We were only able to identify one new study with very low certainty of evidence. Therefore, we remain uncertain about the effects of these types of strategies. Well conducted interventional studies with appropriate control or comparison groups are needed to assess critically the impact of strategies to increase the number of health professionals working in underserved areas. What was studied in the review? All countries have areas that are relatively underserved by health professionals; mostly among rural communities and the urban poor. This problem is seen across the world, but is particularly serious in low‐ and middle‐income countries. While some health professionals choose to work in underserved areas, we need strategies to persuade more of them to do so. Different strategies have been used. For example, some medical schools try to recruit more students with a rural background or arrange for students to practice in rural settings in the hope that graduates will return to those areas to practice. Scholarships, grants, loan repayment schemes and higher salaries have been offered to attract health professionals to underserved areas, while countries also utilise mandatory redeployment strategies. Although some strategies have shown promise, there is a lack of well‐designed studies to measure the short‐term and long‐term effectiveness of these strategies in a rigorous fashion. What are the main results of the review? This review found one new study that evaluated the effect of a National Health Insurance scheme on the distribution of health professionals in Taiwan. Before the implementation of National Health Insurance, people living in rural areas were less able to afford medical costs than their urban counterparts. The implementation of a National Health Insurance scheme made medical care more affordable for all Taiwanese citizens in both urban and rural areas. This may have led to better geographical distribution of health professionals. However, we assessed the certainty of the evidence to be very low. Therefore, we are uncertain about the effects of National Health Insurance schemes on the distribution of health professionals. How up‐to‐date is this review?

Ethical case interventions (e.g. ethics committee, moral case deliberation) identify and analyse ethical conflicts which occur within the context of care for patients. Ethical case interventions involve ethical experts, different health professionals as well as the patient and his/her family. The aim is to support decision‐making in clinical practice. This systematic review gathered and critically appraised the available evidence of controlled studies on the effectiveness of ethical case interventions. Objectives To determine whether ethical case interventions result in reduced decisional conflict or moral distress of those affected by an ethical conflict in clinical practice; improved patient involvement in decision‐making and a higher quality of life in adult patients. To determine the most effective models of ethical case interventions and to analyse the use and appropriateness of the outcomes in experimental studies. Search methods We searched the following electronic databases for primary studies to September 2018: CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and PsycINFO. We also searched CDSR and DARE for related reviews. Furthermore, we searched Clinicaltrials.gov, International Clinical Trials Registry Platform Search Portal and conducted a cited reference search for all included studies in ISI WEB of Science. We also searched the references of the included studies. Selection criteria We included randomised trials, non‐randomised trials, controlled before‐after studies and interrupted time series studies which compared ethical case interventions with usual care or an active control in any language. The included population were adult patients. However, studies with mixed populations consisting of adults and children were included, if a subgroup or sensitivity analysis (or both) was performed for the adult population. Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane and the Effective Practice and Organisation of Care review group. We used meta‐analysis based on a random‐effects model for treatment costs and structured analysis for the remaining outcomes, because these were heterogeneously reported. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of the evidence. Main results We included four randomised trials published in six articles. The publication dates ranged from 2000 to 2014. Three studies were conducted in the USA, and one study in Taiwan. All studies were conducted on intensive care units and included 1165 patients. We judged the included studies to be of moderate or high risk of bias. It was not possible to compare different models of the intervention regarding effectiveness due to the diverse character of the interventions and the small number of studies. Included studies did not directly measure the main outcomes. All studies received public funding and one received additional funding from private sources. We identified two models of ethical case interventions: proactive and request‐based ethics consultation. Three studies evaluated proactive ethics consultation (n = 1103) of which one study reported findings on one key outcome criterion. The studies did not report data on decisional conflict, moral distress of participants of ethical case interventions, patient involvement in decision‐making, quality of life or ethical competency for proactive ethics consultation. One study assessed satisfaction with care on a 5‐point Likert scale (1 = lowest rating, 5 = highest rating). The healthcare providers (nurses and physicians, n = 365) scored a value of 4 or 5 for 81.4% in the control group and 86.1% in the intervention group (P > 0.05). The patients or their surrogates (n = 275) scored a value of 4 or 5 for 83.6% in the control group and for 74.8% in the intervention group (P > 0.05). It was uncertain whether proactive ethics consultation led to high satisfaction with care, because the certainty of evidence was very low. One study evaluated request‐based ethics consultation (n = 62). The study indirectly measured decisional conflict by assessing consensus regarding patient care. The risk (increase in consensus, reduction in decisional conflict) increased by 80% as a result of the intervention. The risk ratio was 0.20 (95% confidence interval 0.09 to 0.46; P < 0.01). It was uncertain whether request‐based ethics consultation reduced decisional conflict, because the certainty of evidence was very low. The study did not report data on moral distress of participants of ethical case interventions, patient involvement in decision‐making, quality of life, or ethical competency or satisfaction with care for request‐based ethics consultation. Authors' conclusions It is not possible to determine the effectiveness of ethical case interventions with certainty due to the low certainty of the evidence of included studies in this review. The effectiveness of ethical case interventions should be investigated in light of the outcomes reported in this systematic review. In addition, there is need for further research to identify and measure outcomes which reflect the goals of different types of ethical case intervention. Plain language summary Can ethical case interventions improve healthcare? What was the aim of this review? The aim of this review was to find out whether ethical case interventions could improve care for patients. Ethical case interventions (e.g. ethics committee, moral case deliberation) identify and analyse ethical conflicts which occur within the context of care for patients. A typical example for situations in which ethical conflicts can arise are cases in which it is uncertain whether provision or limitation of treatment is in line with patients' will or patient welfare (or both). Ethical case interventions involve ethical experts discussing ethical challenges of patient care (specific patient situations) with different health professionals responsible for the care of the patient as well as the patient and his family. The aim of ethical case interventions is to support decision‐making in clinical practice. Researchers in Cochrane collected and analysed all relevant studies to determine whether ethical case interventions improve patient care and found four relevant studies published in six articles. Key messages It was uncertain whether ethical case intervention reduced the decisional conflict of those who need to make decisions about treatment, because the certainty of evidence was very low. We found no studies reporting effects of ethical case interventions on moral distress, patient involvement in decision‐making, patients' quality of life or ethical competency. It was uncertain whether ethical case intervention increased satisfaction with care, because the certainty of evidence was very low. We need more high‐quality studies to evaluate ethical case intervention. What was studied in this review ? We chose the decisional conflict of participants affected by the decision, reduction of moral distress, patient involvement in decision‐making and quality of life of patients as main outcome criteria to assess whether ethical case interventions improve health care. What were the main results of this review? The review authors found four relevant studies with results published in six articles. All studies compared ethical case interventions with usual care in intensive care units. The studies used two different models of ethical case interventions – proactive and request‐based ethics consultation. In proactive ethics consultation, the ethicist himself/herself identifies potential ethical conflicts without being requested or ethics consultation is offered in response to latent conflicts. In request‐based ethics consultation, professionals, patients or their families specifically ask for an ethics consultation to resolve a specific ethical conflict. All studies received public funding and one received additional funding from private sources. Three studies reported on proactive ethics consultation. We found no data on decisional conflict, moral distress, patient involvement in decision‐making, quality of life of patients or ethical competency. One study assessed satisfaction with care. It was uncertain whether proactive ethics consultation increased satisfaction with care, because the certainty of the evidence was very low. One study reported on request‐based ethics consultation. The study assessed the level of consensus regarding decisions about the care of patients as an indirect criterion for the reduction of decisional conflict. It was uncertain whether request‐based ethics consultation increased consensus and, thus, reduced decisional conflict, because the certainty of the evidence was very low. We found no data on moral distress, patient involvement in decision‐making, quality of life of patients or ethical competency. How up to date is this review?

Since many of the factors perceived by nurses as barriers to the implementation of evidence‐based practice (EBP) lie at the organisational level, it is of interest to devise and assess the effectiveness of organisational infrastructures designed to promote EBP among nurses. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of organisational infrastructures in promoting evidence‐based nursing. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC) Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, LILACS, BIREME, IBECS, NHS Economic Evaluations Database, Social Science Citation Index, Science Citation Index and Conference Proceedings Citation Indexes up to 9 March 2011. We developed a new search strategy for this update as the strategy published in 2003 omitted key terms. Additional search methods included: screening reference lists of relevant studies, contacting authors of relevant papers regarding any further published or unpublished work, and searching websites of selected research groups and organisations.  Selection criteria We considered randomised controlled trials, controlled clinical trials, interrupted times series (ITSs) and controlled before and after studies of an entire or identified component of an organisational infrastructure intervention aimed at promoting EBP in nursing. The participants were all healthcare organisations comprising nurses, midwives and health visitors. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. For the ITS analysis, we reported the change in the slopes of the regression lines, and the change in the level effect of the outcome at 3, 6, 12 and 24 months follow‐up. Main results We included one study from the USA (re‐analysed as an ITS) involving one hospital and an unknown number of nurses and patients. The study evaluated the effects of a standardised evidence‐based nursing procedure on nursing care for patients at risk of developing healthcare‐acquired pressure ulcers (HAPUs). If a patient's admission Braden score was below or equal to 18 (i.e. indicating a high risk of developing pressure ulcers), nurses were authorised to initiate a pressure ulcer prevention bundle (i.e. a set of evidence‐based clinical interventions) without waiting for a physician order. Re‐analysis of data as a time series showed that against a background trend of decreasing HAPU rates, if that trend was assumed to be real, there was no evidence of an intervention effect at three months (mean rate per quarter 0.7%; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.7 to 3.3; P = 0.457). Given the small percentages post intervention it was not statistically possible to extrapolate effects beyond three months. Authors' conclusions Despite extensive searching of published and unpublished research we identified only one low‐quality study; we excluded many studies due to non‐eligible study design. If policy‐makers and healthcare organisations wish to promote evidence‐based nursing successfully at an organisational level, they must ensure the funding and conduct of well‐designed studies to generate evidence to guide policy. Plain language summary Can organisational infrastructures be effective in promoting evidence‐based nursing practice? Nurses and midwives form the bulk of the clinical health workforce, and play a central role in all health service delivery. There is potential to improve health care quality if nurses routinely use the best available evidence in their clinical practice. Since many of the factors perceived by nurses as barriers to the implementation of evidence‐based practice (EBP) lie at the organisational level, it is of interest to devise and assess the effectiveness of models to change healthcare organisations in order to promote the use of EBP among nurses successfully. We defined organisational infrastructures as being ""the underlying foundation or basic framework through which clinical care is delivered and supported"", which include for example: organisational policies, nurse development units and other types of organisational developments such as organisations developing and implementing evidence‐based nursing procedures, standards or guidelines for clinical practice. We searched the literature for robust evaluations of the effectiveness of organisational interventions in promoting EBP in nursing. We included one study from the USA which involved one hospital and for which the number of nurses was not reported. The study evaluated the effects of a standardised evidence‐based nursing procedure on improved nursing care for patients at risk of developing healthcare‐acquired pressure ulcers (HAPUs), as measured by the HAPU rate. If a patient's admission Braden score was lower than or equal to 18, nurses were authorised to initiate a prevention pressure ulcer care bundle, without a physician order. The Braden scale is a tool used to assess a patient's risk of developing pressure ulcers. An adult with a score below or equal to 18 is considered to have a high risk for developing a pressure ulcer. Re‐analysis of the HAPU data, as an interrupted time series, was suggestive of a trend in rates prior to intervention and, if that trend was assumed to be real, there was no evidence of an intervention effect at three months (mean rate per quarter 0.7%; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.7 to 3.3; P = 0.457). Given the small percentages post intervention it was not statistically possible to extrapolate effects beyond three months. Considering the importance placed on organisational change in promoting EBP in nursing, it is surprising that eight years after the previous empty Cochrane review was published, appropriately evaluated organisational infrastructure interventions are still lacking. If policy‐makers and healthcare organisations wish to promote evidence‐based nursing at an organisational level successfully, they must ensure the funding and conduct of well‐designed studies to generate evidence to guide policy.",2,"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",1465-1858,"*Efficiency, Organizational; Evidence‐Based Nursing [*methods]; Humans; Nursing Care [*standards]; Outcome and Process Assessment, Health Care [standards]; Pressure Ulcer [prevention & control]",10.1002/14651858.CD002212.pub2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD002212.pub2,Effective Practice and Organisation of Care

The factors contributing to this increase are complex, and identifying interventions to address them is challenging. Non‐clinical interventions are applied independently of a clinical encounter between a health provider and a patient. Such interventions may target women, health professionals or organisations. They address the determinants of caesarean births and could have a role in reducing unnecessary caesarean sections. This review was first published in 2011. This review update will inform a new WHO guideline, and the scope of the update was informed by WHO’s Guideline Development Group for this guideline. Objectives To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of non‐clinical interventions intended to reduce unnecessary caesarean section. Search methods We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and two trials registers in March 2018. We also searched websites of relevant organisations and reference lists of related reviews. Selection criteria Randomised trials, non‐randomised trials, controlled before‐after studies, interrupted time series studies and repeated measures studies were eligible for inclusion. The primary outcome measures were: caesarean section, spontaneous vaginal birth and instrumental birth. Data collection and analysis We followed standard methodological procedures recommended by Cochrane. We narratively described results of individual studies (drawing summarised evidence from single studies assessing distinct interventions). Main results We included 29 studies in this review (19 randomised trials, 1 controlled before‐after study and 9 interrupted time series studies). Most of the studies (20 studies) were conducted in high‐income countries and none took place in low‐income countries. The studies enrolled a mixed population of pregnant women, including nulliparous women, multiparous women, women with a fear of childbirth, women with high levels of anxiety and women having undergone a previous caesarean section. Overall, we found low‐, moderate‐ or high‐certainty evidence that the following interventions have a beneficial effect on at least one primary outcome measure and no moderate‐ or high‐certainty evidence of adverse effects. Interventions targeted at women or families Childbirth training workshops for mothers alone may reduce caesarean section (risk ratio (RR) 0.55, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.33 to 0.89) and may increase spontaneous vaginal birth (RR 2.25, 95% CI 1.16 to 4.36). Childbirth training workshops for couples may reduce caesarean section (RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.94) and may increase spontaneous vaginal birth (RR 2.13, 95% CI 1.09 to 4.16). We judged this one study with 60 participants to have low‐certainty evidence for the outcomes above. Nurse‐led applied relaxation training programmes (RR 0.22, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.43; 104 participants, low‐certainty evidence) and psychosocial couple‐based prevention programmes (RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.90; 147 participants, low‐certainty evidence) may reduce caesarean section. Psychoeducation may increase spontaneous vaginal birth (RR 1.33, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.61; 371 participants, low‐certainty evidence). The control group received routine maternity care in all studies. There were insufficient data on the effect of the four interventions on maternal and neonatal mortality or morbidity. Interventions targeted at healthcare professionals Implementation of clinical practice guidelines combined with mandatory second opinion for caesarean section indication slightly reduces the risk of overall caesarean section (mean difference in rate change ‐1.9%, 95% CI ‐3.8 to ‐0.1; 149,223 participants). Implementation of clinical practice guidelines combined with audit and feedback also slightly reduces the risk of caesarean section (risk difference (RD) ‐1.8%, 95% CI ‐3.8 to ‐0.2; 105,351 participants). Physician education by local opinion leader (obstetrician‐gynaecologist) reduced the risk of elective caesarean section to 53.7% from 66.8% (opinion leader education: 53.7%, 95% CI 46.5 to 61.0%; control: 66.8%, 95% CI 61.7 to 72.0%; 2496 participants). Healthcare professionals in the control groups received routine care in the studies. There was little or no difference in maternal and neonatal mortality or morbidity between study groups. We judged the certainty of evidence to be high. Interventions targeted at healthcare organisations or facilities Collaborative midwifery‐labourist care (in which the obstetrician provides in‐house labour and delivery coverage, 24 hours a day, without competing clinical duties), versus a private practice model of care, may reduce the primary caesarean section rate. In one interrupted time series study, the caesarean section rate decreased by 7% in the year after the intervention, and by 1.7% per year thereafter (1722 participants); the vaginal birth rate after caesarean section increased from 13.3% before to 22.4% after the intervention (684 participants). Maternal and neonatal mortality were not reported. We judged the certainty of evidence to be low. We studied the following interventions, and they either made little or no difference to caesarean section rates or had uncertain effects. Moderate‐certainty evidence suggests little or no difference in caesarean section rates between usual care and: antenatal education programmes for physiologic childbirth; antenatal education on natural childbirth preparation with training in breathing and relaxation techniques; computer‐based decision aids; individualised prenatal education and support programmes (versus written information in pamphlet). Low‐certainty evidence suggests little or no difference in caesarean section rates between usual care and: psychoeducation; pelvic floor muscle training exercises with telephone follow‐up (versus pelvic floor muscle training without telephone follow‐up); intensive group therapy (cognitive behavioural therapy and childbirth psychotherapy); education of public health nurses on childbirth classes; role play (versus standard education using lectures); interactive decision aids (versus educational brochures); labourist model of obstetric care (versus traditional model of obstetric care). We are very uncertain as to the effect of other interventions identified on caesarean section rates as the certainty of the evidence is very low. Authors' conclusions We evaluated a wide range of non‐clinical interventions to reduce unnecessary caesarean section, mostly in high‐income settings. Few interventions with moderate‐ or high‐certainty evidence, mainly targeting healthcare professionals (implementation of guidelines combined with mandatory second opinion, implementation of guidelines combined with audit and feedback, physician education by local opinion leader) have been shown to safely reduce caesarean section rates. There are uncertainties in existing evidence related to very‐low or low‐certainty evidence, applicability of interventions and lack of studies, particularly around interventions targeted at women or families and healthcare organisations or facilities. Plain language summary Non‐clinical interventions for reducing unnecessary caesarean section What is the aim of this review? The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out whether non‐clinical interventions, which aim to reduce unnecessary caesarean sections, such as providing education to healthcare workers and mothers, are safe and effective. This review was first published in 2011. This review update will inform a new WHO guideline, and the scope of the update was informed by WHO’s Guideline Development Group for this guideline. Key messages We studied a wide range of non‐clinical interventions that aim to reduce unnecessary caesarean sections, mostly in high‐income countries. Based on high‐quality evidence, few interventions have been shown to reduce caesarean section rates without adverse effects on maternal or neonatal outcomes. These interventions are mainly aimed at healthcare professionals (nurses, midwives, physicians) and involve using: clinical guidelines combined with mandatory second opinion for caesarean section indication; clinical guidelines combined with audit and feedback about caesarean section practices; and opinion leaders (obstetrician/gynaecologist) to provide education to healthcare professionals. What was studied in this review? Caesarean section is an operation used to prevent and reduce complications of childbirth. While it can be a life‐saving procedure for both the mother and baby, caesarean section is not without harm and should only be carried out when necessary. Caesarean sections increase the likelihood of bleeding, maternal infections and infant breathing problems, among other complications. The number of caesarean sections performed has been increasing worldwide. Whilst there may be medical reasons for this increase, other factors, such as clinician convenience and maternal fears, may also be responsible. What are the main results of the review? We included 29 studies in this review. Most of the studies (20 studies) were conducted in high‐income countries; none in low‐income countries. We rated the quality of the evidence from studies using four levels: very low, low, moderate, or high. Very low‐quality means that we are very uncertain about the results. High‐quality evidence means that we are very confident in the results. Overall, we found eight of the 29 interventions included in the review to have a beneficial effect on at least one of our main outcomes with low‐, moderate‐ or high‐quality evidence, and no moderate‐ or high‐quality evidence of harm: Interventions aimed at women or families : providing childbirth training workshops for mothers and couples; relaxation training programmes led by nurses; psychosocial couple‐based prevention programmes; and psychoeducation. The interventions were compared to routine practice. The quality of evidence from the studies was low. Interventions aimed at healthcare professionals:  using clinical guidelines combined with mandatory second opinion for caesarean section indication; using clinical guidelines combined with audit and feedback about caesarean section practices; and having opinion leaders (obstetrician/gynaecologist) provide education to healthcare professionals. The interventions were compared to routine practice. The quality of evidence was high. Interventions aimed at healthcare organisations or facilities : collaborative midwifery‐labourist model of care (in which the obstetrician provides in‐house labour and delivery coverage, 24 hours a day, without competing clinical duties) compared to a private model of care. The quality of evidence was low. We studied a number of other interventions and they either made little or no difference to caesarean section rates, or had uncertain effects. Limited data were available on possible harms associated with the interventions examined in this review. How up‐to‐date is this review?

CD003543.PUB4,"Davey, P; Marwick, CA; Scott, CL; Charani, E; McNeil, K; Brown, E; Gould, IM; Ramsay, CR; Michie, S",Interventions to improve antibiotic prescribing practices for hospital inpatients,Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews,2017,"Abstract - Background Antibiotic resistance is a major public health problem. Infections caused by multidrug‐resistant bacteria are associated with prolonged hospital stay and death compared with infections caused by susceptible bacteria. Appropriate antibiotic use in hospitals should ensure effective treatment of patients with infection and reduce unnecessary prescriptions. We updated this systematic review to evaluate the impact of interventions to improve antibiotic prescribing to hospital inpatients. Objectives To estimate the effectiveness and safety of interventions to improve antibiotic prescribing to hospital inpatients and to investigate the effect of two intervention functions: restriction and enablement. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (the Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, and Embase. We searched for additional studies using the bibliographies of included articles and personal files. The last search from which records were evaluated and any studies identified incorporated into the review was January 2015. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and non‐randomised studies (NRS). We included three non‐randomised study designs to measure behavioural and clinical outcomes and analyse variation in the effects: non‐ randomised trials (NRT), controlled before‐after (CBA) studies and interrupted time series (ITS) studies. For this update we also included three additional NRS designs (case control, cohort, and qualitative studies) to identify unintended consequences. Interventions included any professional or structural interventions as defined by the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care Group. We defined restriction as 'using rules to reduce the opportunity to engage in the target behaviour (or increase the target behaviour by reducing the opportunity to engage in competing behaviours)'. We defined enablement as 'increasing means/reducing barriers to increase capability or opportunity'. The main comparison was between intervention and no intervention. Data collection and analysis Two review authors extracted data and assessed study risk of bias. We performed meta‐analysis and meta‐regression of RCTs and meta‐regression of ITS studies. We classified behaviour change functions for all interventions in the review, including those studies in the previously published versions. We analysed dichotomous data with a risk difference (RD). We assessed certainty of evidence with GRADE criteria. Main results This review includes 221 studies (58 RCTs, and 163 NRS). Most studies were from North America (96) or Europe (87). The remaining studies were from Asia (19), South America (8), Australia (8), and the East Asia (3). Although 62% of RCTs were at a high risk of bias, the results for the main review outcomes were similar when we restricted the analysis to studies at low risk of bias. More hospital inpatients were treated according to antibiotic prescribing policy with the intervention compared with no intervention based on 29 RCTs of predominantly enablement interventions (RD 15%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 14% to 16%; 23,394 participants; high‐certainty evidence). This represents an increase from 43% to 58% .There were high levels of heterogeneity of effect size but the direction consistently favoured intervention. The duration of antibiotic treatment decreased by 1.95 days (95% CI 2.22 to 1.67; 14 RCTs; 3318 participants; high‐certainty evidence) from 11.0 days. Information from non‐randomised studies showed interventions to be associated with improvement in prescribing according to antibiotic policy in routine clinical practice, with 70% of interventions being hospital‐wide compared with 31% for RCTs. The risk of death was similar between intervention and control groups (11% in both arms), indicating that antibiotic use can likely be reduced without adversely affecting mortality (RD 0%, 95% CI ‐1% to 0%; 28 RCTs; 15,827 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). Antibiotic stewardship interventions probably reduce length of stay by 1.12 days (95% CI 0.7 to 1.54 days; 15 RCTs; 3834 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). One RCT and six NRS raised concerns that restrictive interventions may lead to delay in treatment and negative professional culture because of breakdown in communication and trust between infection specialists and clinical teams (low‐certainty evidence). Both enablement and restriction were independently associated with increased compliance with antibiotic policies, and enablement enhanced the effect of restrictive interventions (high‐certainty evidence). Enabling interventions that included feedback were probably more effective than those that did not (moderate‐certainty evidence). There was very low‐certainty evidence about the effect of the interventions on reducing  Clostridium difficile  infections (median ‐48.6%, interquartile range ‐80.7% to ‐19.2%; 7 studies). This was also the case for resistant gram‐negative bacteria (median ‐12.9%, interquartile range ‐35.3% to 25.2%; 11 studies) and resistant gram‐positive bacteria (median ‐19.3%, interquartile range ‐50.1% to +23.1%; 9 studies). There was too much variance in microbial outcomes to reliably assess the effect of change in antibiotic use. Heterogeneity of intervention effect on prescribing outcomes We analysed effect modifiers in 29 RCTs and 91 ITS studies. Enablement and restriction were independently associated with a larger effect size (high‐certainty evidence). Feedback was included in 4 (17%) of 23 RCTs and 20 (47%) of 43 ITS studies of enabling interventions and was associated with greater intervention effect. Enablement was included in 13 (45%) of 29 ITS studies with restrictive interventions and enhanced intervention effect. Authors' conclusions We found high‐certainty evidence that interventions are effective in increasing compliance with antibiotic policy and reducing duration of antibiotic treatment. Lower use of antibiotics probably does not increase mortality and likely reduces length of stay. Additional trials comparing antibiotic stewardship with no intervention are unlikely to change our conclusions. Enablement consistently increased the effect of interventions, including those with a restrictive component. Although feedback further increased intervention effect, it was used in only a minority of enabling interventions. Interventions were successful in safely reducing unnecessary antibiotic use in hospitals, despite the fact that the majority did not use the most effective behaviour change techniques. Consequently, effective dissemination of our findings could have considerable health service and policy impact. Future research should instead focus on targeting treatment and assessing other measures of patient safety, assess different stewardship interventions, and explore the barriers and facilitators to implementation. More research is required on unintended consequences of restrictive interventions. Plain language summary Improving how physicians working in hospital settings prescribe antibiotics Review aim The aim of this Cochrane review was to learn of ways to improve how physicians working in hospital settings prescribe antibiotics. We collected and analysed all relevant studies to answer this question and found 221 studies. Key messages The use of an antibiotic policy leads to improved prescribing practices and decreases in the duration of antibiotic treatment. Interventions that are directed to physicians to improve their antibiotic prescribing practices reduced participant length of stay in hospitals by 1.12 days (based on findings from 15 studies) and did not increase the risk of death (based on findings from 29 studies). Interventions providing advice or feedback to physicians were more effective in improving prescribing practices than those interventions that did not provide this information to physicians. Evidence from seven studies raised concerns that with interventions applying rules to make physicians prescribe properly there were delays in treatment and a breakdown in trust between infection specialists and clinical teams. What was studied in the review? Antibiotics are used to treat bacterial infections such as pneumonia. Many bacteria have become resistant to antibiotics over time. Antibiotic resistance is a serious problem for patients and healthcare systems because infections caused by antibiotic‐resistant bacteria can lead to higher rates of death and longer hospital stays. Bacterial resistance often occurs because antibiotics are used when they are not needed. Studies have shown that in about half of cases physicians in hospital are not prescribing antibiotics properly. We investigated the effectiveness and safety of interventions to help physicians prescribe antibiotics properly and what techniques of behaviour change could influence the success of the interventions. Key results We found 221 relevant studies. Ninety‐six studies were from North America. The remaining 125 studies were from Europe (87), Asia (19), South America (8), Australia (8), and East Asia (3). The studies tested interventions that fell broadly into two categories: restrictive techniques, which apply rules to make physicians prescribe properly, and enablement techniques, which provide advice or feedback to help physicians prescribe properly. We found high‐certainty evidence that interventions lead to more hospital inpatients receiving the appropriate treatment for their condition according to antibiotic prescribing policies. We found moderate‐certainty evidence that interventions reduce the length of hospital stay without increasing patient deaths. Both restriction and enabling techniques were successful in achieving effectiveness of the intervention. We do not need more studies to answer the question of whether these interventions reduce unnecessary antibiotic use, but we do need more research to understand the unintended consequences of the use of restrictive interventions. Interventions were successful in safely reducing unnecessary antibiotic use in hospitals, despite the fact that the majority did not use a widely adopted behaviour change technique, which is to audit and provide feedback on performance. Effective communication of the review results could have considerable health service and policy impact. How up‐to‐date is the review?

CD011227.PUB2,"Weeks, G; George, J; Maclure, K; Stewart, D",Non‐medical prescribing versus medical prescribing for acute and chronic disease management in primary and secondary care,Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews,2016,"Abstract - Background A range of health workforce strategies are needed to address health service demands in low‐, middle‐ and high‐income countries. Non‐medical prescribing involves nurses, pharmacists, allied health professionals, and physician assistants substituting for doctors in a prescribing role, and this is one approach to improve access to medicines. Objectives To assess clinical, patient‐reported, and resource use outcomes of non‐medical prescribing for managing acute and chronic health conditions in primary and secondary care settings compared with medical prescribing (usual care). Search methods We searched databases including CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and five other databases on 19 July 2016. We also searched the grey literature and handsearched bibliographies of relevant papers and publications. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster‐RCTs, controlled before‐and‐after (CBA) studies (with at least two intervention and two control sites) and interrupted time series analysis (with at least three observations before and after the intervention) comparing: 1. non‐medical prescribing versus medical prescribing in acute care; 2. non‐medical prescribing versus medical prescribing in chronic care; 3. non‐medical prescribing versus medical prescribing in secondary care; 4 non‐medical prescribing versus medical prescribing in primary care; 5. comparisons between different non‐medical prescriber groups; and 6. non‐medical healthcare providers with formal prescribing training versus those without formal prescribing training. Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Two review authors independently reviewed studies for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed study quality with discrepancies resolved by discussion. Two review authors independently assessed risk of bias for the included studies according to EPOC criteria. We undertook meta‐analyses using the fixed‐effect model where studies were examining the same treatment effect and to account for small sample sizes. We compared outcomes to a random‐effects model where clinical or statistical heterogeneity existed. Main results We included 46 studies (37,337 participants); non‐medical prescribing was undertaken by nurses in 26 studies and pharmacists in 20 studies. In 45 studies non‐medical prescribing as a component of care was compared with usual care medical prescribing. A further study compared nurse prescribing supported by guidelines with usual nurse prescribing care. No studies were found with non‐medical prescribing being undertaken by other health professionals. The education requirement for non‐medical prescribing varied with country and location. A meta‐analysis of surrogate markers of chronic disease (systolic blood pressure, glycated haemoglobin, and low‐density lipoprotein) showed positive intervention group effects. There was a moderate‐certainty of evidence for studies of blood pressure at 12 months (mean difference (MD) ‐5.31 mmHg, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐6.46 to ‐4.16; 12 studies, 4229 participants) and low‐density lipoprotein (MD ‐0.21, 95% CI ‐0.29 to ‐0.14; 7 studies, 1469 participants); we downgraded the certainty of evidence from high due to considerations of serious inconsistency (considerable heterogeneity), multifaceted interventions, and variable prescribing autonomy. A high‐certainty of evidence existed for comparative studies of glycated haemoglobin management at 12 months (MD ‐0.62, 95% CI ‐0.85 to ‐0.38; 6 studies, 775 participants). While there appeared little difference in medication adherence across studies, a meta‐analysis of continuous outcome data from four studies showed an effect favouring patient adherence in the non‐medical prescribing group (MD 0.15, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.30; 4 studies, 700 participants). We downgraded the certainty of evidence for adherence to moderate due to the serious risk of performance bias. While little difference was seen in patient‐related adverse events between treatment groups, we downgraded the certainty of evidence to low due to indirectness, as the range of adverse events may not be related to the intervention and selective reporting failed to adequately report adverse events in many studies. Patients were generally satisfied with non‐medical prescriber care (14 studies, 7514 participants). We downgraded the certainty of evidence from high to moderate due to indirectness, in that satisfaction with the prescribing component of care was only addressed in one study, and there was variability of satisfaction measures with little use of validated tools. A meta‐analysis of health‐related quality of life scores (SF‐12 and SF‐36) found a difference favouring non‐medical prescriber care for the physical component score (MD 1.17, 95% CI 0.16 to 2.17), and the mental component score (MD 0.58, 95% CI ‐0.40 to 1.55). However, the quality of life measurement may more appropriately reflect composite care rather than the prescribing component of care, and for this reason we downgraded the certainty of evidence to moderate due to indirectness of the measure of effect. A wide variety of resource use measures were reported across studies with little difference between groups for hospitalisations, emergency department visits, and outpatient visits. In the majority of studies reporting medication use, non‐medical prescribers prescribed more drugs, intensified drug doses, and used a greater variety of drugs compared to usual care medical prescribers. The risk of bias across studies was generally low for selection bias (random sequence generation), detection bias (blinding of outcome assessment), attrition bias (incomplete outcome data), and reporting bias (selective reporting). There was an unclear risk of selection bias (allocation concealment) and for other biases. A high risk of performance bias (blinding of participants and personnel) existed. Authors' conclusions The findings suggest that non‐medical prescribers, practising with varying but high levels of prescribing autonomy, in a range of settings, were as effective as usual care medical prescribers. Non‐medical prescribers can deliver comparable outcomes for systolic blood pressure, glycated haemoglobin, low‐density lipoprotein, medication adherence, patient satisfaction, and health‐related quality of life. It was difficult to determine the impact of non‐medical prescribing compared to medical prescribing for adverse events and resource use outcomes due to the inconsistency and variability in reporting across studies. Future efforts should be directed towards more rigorous studies that can clearly identify the clinical, patient‐reported, resource use, and economic outcomes of non‐medical prescribing, in both high‐income and low‐income countries. Plain language summary Prescribing roles for health professionals other than doctors What is the aim of this review? The aim of this Cochrane review was to find out if prescribing by health professionals other than doctors delivers comparable outcomes to prescribing by doctors. Cochrane researchers collected and analysed all relevant studies to answer this question and found 46 studies. Key messages With appropriate training and support, nurses and pharmacists are able to prescribe medicines as part of managing a range of conditions to achieve comparable health management outcomes to doctors. The majority of studies focus on chronic disease management in higher‐income counties where there is generally a moderate‐certainty of evidence supporting similar outcomes for the markers of disease in high blood pressure, diabetes, and high cholesterol. Further high‐quality studies are needed in poorer countries and to better quantify differences in prescribing outcomes for adverse events, and to determine health economic outcomes. Further studies could also focus more specifically on the prescribing component of care. What was studied in the review? A number of countries allow health professionals other than doctors to prescribe medicines. This shift in roles is thought to provide improved and timely access to medicines for consumers where there are shortages of doctors or the health system is facing pressures in coping with the burden of disease. In addition, this task shift has been supported by a number of governments as a way to more appropriately use the skills of health professionals, such as nurses and pharmacists, in the care of patients. We compared the outcomes of any healthcare workers who were prescribing with a high degree of autonomy with medical prescribers in the hospital or community setting in low‐, middle‐ and high‐income countries. What are the main results of the review? This review found 45 studies where nurses and pharmacists with high levels of prescribing autonomy were compared with usual care medical prescribers. A further study compared nurse prescribing with guideline support with usual nurse prescribing care. No studies were found with other health professionals or lay prescribers. Four nurse prescribing studies were undertaken in the low‐ and middle‐income settings of Colombia, South Africa, Uganda, and Thailand. The remainder of studies were undertaken in high‐income Western countries. Forty‐two studies were based in a community setting, two studies were located in hospitals, one study in the workplace, and one study in an aged care facility. Prescribing was but one part of many health‐related interventions, particularly in the management of chronic disease. The review found that the outcomes for non‐medical prescribers were comparable to medical prescribers for: high blood pressure (moderate‐certainty of evidence); diabetes control (high‐certainty of evidence); high cholesterol (moderate‐certainty of evidence); adverse events (low‐certainty of evidence); patients adhering to their medication regimens (moderate‐certainty of evidence); patient satisfaction with care (moderate‐certainty of evidence); and health‐related quality of life (moderate‐certainty of evidence). Pharmacists and nurses with varying levels of undergraduate, postgraduate, and specific on‐the‐job training related to the disease or condition were able to deliver comparable prescribing outcomes to doctors. Non‐medical prescribers frequently had medical support available to facilitate a collaborative practice model. How up‐to‐date is this review?
